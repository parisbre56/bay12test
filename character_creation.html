<h1>Stat and Skill Rules</h1>
<h3>Character creation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Everyone starts with zero levels and zero points in all stats and skills.</li>
  <li>You can add positive levels during character creation, but must take a greater penalty each time you do so. These are reffered to as 'Initial levels' in this page.
  <ul>
    <li>Having a <em>total</em> of +1 positive intial levels means you must take a total of -1 negative intial levels.</li>
    <li>Having a <em>total</em> of +2 positive intial levels means you must take a total of -3 negative intial levels.</li>
    <li>Having a <em>total</em> of +3 positive intial levels means you must take a total of -6 negative intial levels.</li>
    <li>Having a <em>total</em> of +4 positive intial levels means you must take a total of -10 negative intial levels.</li>
    <li>Note that the total is different between stats and skills. <br>You cannot mix the total initial levels for stats with the total initial levels for skills. <br>You <strong>cannot</strong> have +1 strength and +1 willpower for -2 endurance and -1 conventional.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Your second increase to 1 can be taken at a cost of -1
  <ul>
    <li>This +1 does not count toward the cummulative total</li>
	<li>This 1 *can* be increased, using the normal system</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>You can not have an initial level lower than -2.</li>
  <li><strong>Only</strong> during character generation, you cannot have an initial level greater than 2.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Level up</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You get 5 points for stats and 5 for skills at the end of each mission.
  <ul>
    <li>Getting from level -2 to level -1 takes 10 points.</li>
    <li>Getting from level -1 to level 0 takes 5 points.</li>
    <li>Getting from level 0 to level 1 takes 5 points.</li>
    <li>Getting from level 1 to level 2 takes 10 points.</li>
    <li>Getting from level 2 to level 3 takes 15 points.</li>
    <li>
    	Getting from level 3 to level 4 takes 20. <br>
    	To get to level 4 from level 0, in other words, you'd need to spend 50 points, or 10 missions worth. <br>
    	On the other hand, if you have an initial level of 2 on a skill, you can reach level 4 with just 35 points or 7 missions worth. <br>
    	And with the enhanced capacity genemod, you can shorten this to just 15 points or 3 missions worth. 
    </li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Note that special circumstances (brain damage, genemods, alien parasites, Doctor experimentation, etc.) may change the number of points given or may result in point deduction.</li>
  <li>Enhanced Capacity upgrades are addons that can be bought from the armoury and can give you a +1 to <strong>either</strong> 1 stat or 1 skill. You can have only one of them installed at a time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Extra rules for old characters</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Anompalous Planetoid mission counts as two missions and thus gives two levelups instead of one.</li>
  <li>Those that got points during the Hephaestus timeskip get 5 extra points to put in <strong>either</strong> stats or skills or a combination of the two. <br>That means that they can put 2 points in strength and 3 points in intuition, for example.</li>
  <li>Those that participated in the Hephaestus space battle get 5 extra points to put in <strong>either</strong> stats or skills or a combination of the two. <br>That means that they can put 2 points in strength and 3 points in intuition, for example.</li>
  <li>Lars gets a +1 level to Fate without the need to take extra negative levels for it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Explanation of the Level System</h3>
<p>Levels do not offer direct bonuses to rolls. Instead, they affect how the results of a roll will be interpreted. Generally, when your level is higher, you can succeed on a lower roll and the results of failure are not so severe. However, note that all levels are situational, so even someone with a +4 might fail something very hard.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h4>-2: Disaster</h4>
		<p>This character is so bad with this skill that it's like they have some sort of curse. 1 is basically an automatic death, maybe permanently. 6 will kill people around you. Anything other then a 5 will fail to some degree, and even 5's will usually have you complete the action in an unorthodox and perhaps not great manner.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>-1: Hazard</h4>
		<p>This is one level below Complete Novice. This is someone who thinks they know what they're doing, but is actually dangerously, often fatally, mistaken. 1's will be reality bending disastrous, 6's will be monkey's paws in which the thing gets done, but I as the GM take near fetishistic pleasure in twisting your desires toward some horrible end. Other rolls will generally be varying levels of failure and minor success, with 5's being succeeding through dumb luck.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>+0: Complete Novice</h4>
		<p>This is someone who has no idea what they're doing, but at least they realize they have no idea what they're doing. They can only guess their way through things, but their unbiased ignorance will cause less problems.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>+1: Experienced</h4>
		<p>This is someone who has some knowledge of what they're doing. They're not an expert or anything, but they know the ins and outs of standard actions and can get by fairly well in normal circumstances. Most people could be considered “Experienced” when it comes to driving a car: They probably know a bit about how it works, and can operate it effectively under normal conditions basically without fail. This is when rolls start getting a bit more situational: Standard un-stressed stuff will still get a roll, but 1's will basically act like 2's and 6's like 5's. In other words un-stressed rolls will usually succeed to some degree. Stressed things will be much the same as a novice's rolls, but with somewhat lessened consequences for 1's and 6's. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>+2: Professional</h4>
		<p>This is someone who knows what they're doing even in stressful or novel situations. A well trained soldier would usually be considered a professional with their weapon. In unstressful and known situations, professionals will always succeed. Rolls will still be used, they'll just be used to see the level of success. In other cases, unfamiliar circumstances or stressful situations, it will be rolls as usual, but for the most part 1's and 6's won't be considered much more then just straight failures or successes with no consequences. The only time there might be consequences is when extenuating circumstances (Bad equipment, for instance) give a good reason for it. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>+3: Specialist</h4>
		<p>Someone who is beyond a professional. Someone who is a specialist is highly trained with whatever they're doing. They're much like the professional, with the same auto succeeds, but they are also simply better at their actions. At this point, every roll except 1 is a success, with 5-6's being better then 4-3-2, but still. At least in most circumstances. Again, it becomes situational; A Con specialist should be able to accurately hit stationary targets very reliably. However, if you throw him onto a moving truck and tell him to snipe a guy moving perpendicular to him on a train car, the success rate starts getting lower. Basically, this is success baring extenuating circumstances.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>+4 and on: Master</h4>
		<p>Remember pai mei from Kill bill? Yeah, like that. You basically always roll 5's in the majority of circumstances. Things need to be actively restricting you in order to make failure a chance. Note however that even in this level, in certain situations, rolling a 1 is still bad, since it could mean your action not succeeding as much as you'd like it to. It is not mechanichally equivelant to always rolling 5s.</p>
		<p>Note that having a level greater than 4 does not aid you in any way, except when using functions that somehow deduct levels from you. For example, Limiter Unlock makes the player auto-succeed in a roll for a turn, but at the cost of lowering the rolled stat or skill by 1 level. If someone at level 5 used a limiter unlock, they would drop to level 4, thus retaining their former capacity, since the two levels are equivalent.</p>

Useful in hand to hand combat, for throwing things and for lifting things (including some weapons or weapons you'd normally be unable to lift). Note that this stat doesn't describe your actual amount of strength; Instead it controls how well you control what strength you have. A giant robot with -2 strength will accidentally crush things it meant to lightly tap, and lightly tap things which it mean to crush.

This stat is required to wield some weapons (most notably gauss rifles) and heavy equipment. This stat is rolled for hand to hand combat, melee weapons that don't use unconventional and other similar things.">

People with a high level of this skill can construct almost anything provided they have the right parts. Very useful if you are going to be working with tinker and custom equipment in general and don't want to pay someone else to construct your prototypes. Also very useful in those situations when you are trapped somewhere with limited resources and need to construct something to survive and/or escape and generally building your own spare parts. Overshoots may cause you to weld yourself to what you are building or cause it to explode prematurely or overload.">

Overshoots tend to destroy your target with some bad side effects (for example, overkill, wasting ammo, friendly fire or structural damage) while critfails may cause you to shoot yourself.">

Useful for surviving damage and enduring effects such as poison, overmedication, drunkenness and tiredness.

Some times the weapon that hit you might be so powerful (or your failure so great) that endurance will do nothing more than dictate whether or not your brain will remain intact enough to be revived.">

Also used for ranged weapons that don't belong in the other weapon categories (Conventional,Exotic,Auxiliary). Overshoots and critfails tend to have effects similar with those that happen with conventional weapons. Special mention should be made to manipulator critfails, since they can have very nasty effects (like making your blood boil or causing the manipulator to explode like a grenade). ">

Can be used to look cool, beautiful and generally make a good impression on people or conversely infiltrate locations and move amongst them unnoticed, hiding in plain sight. People with low level of skill and no decompensators can use it to terrorize civilians, cause misunderstandings and speak in the most hilarious of ways. People who are competent with speech however should be able to fool enemies, persuade civilians to do things, make inspiring speeches and increase the effectiveness of their mind control amps.

This stat is required to use the mind control kind of Psychokinetic Amplifiers. It can also be useful when combined with equipment like the Black Halo.">

Your gut feeling. Are your guts feeling well? No? Time to dive into trench because something bad is about to happen.
