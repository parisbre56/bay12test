Note that this stat doesn't describe your actual amount of strength; Instead it controls how well you control what strength you have. A giant robot with -2 strength will accidentally crush things it meant to lightly tap, and lightly tap things which it mean to crush.

Also very useful in those situations when you are trapped somewhere with limited resources and need to construct something to survive and/or escape and generally building your own spare parts.

Some times the weapon that hit you might be so powerful (or your failure so great) that endurance will do nothing more than dictate whether or not your brain will remain intact enough to be revived.">

Also used for ranged weapons that don't belong in the other weapon categories (Conventional,Exotic,Auxiliary).

Can be used to look cool, beautiful and generally make a good impression on people or conversely infiltrate locations and move amongst them unnoticed, hiding in plain sight. People with low level of skill can use it to terrorize civilians, cause misunderstandings and speak in the most hilarious of ways. People who are competent with speech however should be able to fool enemies, persuade civilians to do things, make inspiring speeches and increase the effectiveness of their mind control amps.

Also used for Psychokinetic Amplifiers (&quot;magic&quot; brain implants that can break physics).
