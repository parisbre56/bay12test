  Useful in hand to hand combat, for throwing things and for lifting things (including some weapons or weapons you'd normally be unable to lift). Note that this stat doesn't describe your actual amount of strength; Instead it controls how well you control what strength you have. A giant robot with -2 strength will accidentally crush things it meant to lightly tap, and lightly tap things which it mean to crush.
  This stat is required to wield some weapons (most notably gauss rifles) and heavy equipment. This stat is rolled for hand to hand combat, melee weapons that don't use unconventional and other similar things.">

People with a high level of this skill can construct almost anything provided they have the right parts. Very useful if you are going to be working with tinker and custom equipment in general and don't want to pay someone else to construct your prototypes. Also very useful in those situations when you are trapped somewhere with limited resources and need to construct something to survive and/or escape and generally building your own spare parts. Overshoots may cause you to weld yourself to what you are building or cause it to explode prematurely or overload.">
