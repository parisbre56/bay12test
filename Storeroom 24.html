On November 12, 2082, fearing invasion from a hostile Chinese owned H3 mining settlement, Starline operatives delivered and then detonated a 50 megaton nuclear weapon within the Mining settlement. This preemptive attack resulted in over 100,000 direct and indirect deaths, many from the collapse of civilian housing blocks situated below and near the site. Although, by far, not the first nuclear weapon used during the Lunar Conflicts, it was by far the largest and drew an uproar of popular outrage and hatred. The Starline Bombing is considered to be one of the principle driving forces behind the Lunar Treaty of 2083. \n\n[[Return|03]]</div><div tiddler="0024-7547 Starline MC Mass Driver scale model" tags="" modified="201405241657" created="201405241657" modifier="twee">You open the drawer and the artifact within floats out of its own accord, expanding back into its original size and coming to rest on the ground in front of you. \n\nits a diorama or display of sorts, a scale model of a lunar mass driver in a glass case.

The mass driver itself is fairly uninteresting to look at, not much more than a long rail stretching off across flattened, gray lunar soil. In order to accommodate the entire length of the rail the scale is so great that the actual control buildings and power infrastructure, already a rather plain series of boxy white buildings clustered around the start of the mass driver, have been relegated to little more than a sugar cube village, lacking any detail. \n\n[[&quot;Info&quot;|Mass Driver Info]]\n[[Return|03]]</div><div tiddler="0024-6842 Swiss Guard SA 660 Assault rifle" tags="" modified="201405241648" created="201405241648" modifier="twee">You open the drawer and the artifact within floats out of its own accord, expanding back into its original size and hovering just in front of you. \n\nIts a rifle; one of the archaic, explosive driven designs which fired bits of lead cloaked in brass. its barrel is much more slender than modern weapons, no wire coils to take up space.

The barrel has been engraved with “ego te absolvo” on one side, and “Acriter et Fidelite” on the other, and a string of small, plain, reddish colored beads has been wrapped around the hand guard.

Their true motivations are the subject of some degree of historical debate: Many made great personal gains, and the methods by which they raised support were, at times, morally questionable. Regardless of their intentions, they played a pivotal role in the advancement of human exploration and colonization. Though they would eventually seed colonies across many Jovian Moons, their initial work revolved around the creation of an orbital construction platform known as The Polaris and the manufacture of pieces of The Galileo, A massive colonization ship which would be shipped, piece by piece to Ceres where it would then be constructed and fly the rest of the way to Europa. \n\nThis plague, originally located aboard the Polaris, was recovered from the Pacific after the Polaris platform was damaged by wreckage from the Virata and forced to be deorbited in October of 2203. \n\n[[Return|03]]</div><div tiddler="0024-5597 “Ceres is Free” Sticker" tags="" modified="201405241648" created="201405241648" modifier="twee">You open the drawer and the artifact within floats out of its own accord, expanding back into its original size and hovering just in front of you. \n\nThe artifact is a sheet of fist sized stickers.

The Wayfarer branch of Islam originated in the religious centers of reconstruction Africa, and quickly became popular amongst younger practitioners, but failed to distinguish itself as a separate entity for decades.  The mosque on Ceres was important for many reasons, not only because it was the first of its kind and established the Wayfarers as their own religion, but because it set the precedent of aggressive, but non-violent,  exploration and expansion for which they would be known. The Mosque of Sol became not simply a place of worship, but a great archive of artifacts and specimens attained durring the pilgrimages of the Wayfarers, as well as chronicles of these journeys, religious texts and treaties. \n\nThis tile, obtained by the Walker institute after the collapse of the Northern great dome in 3392, was originally part of a large mosaic which spanned the upper floors of one of the Mosque's reading areas. \n\n[[Return|03]]</div><div tiddler="Globe Info" tags="" modified="201405241937" created="201405241937" modifier="twee">.&gt; This globe depicts the division of land during the early Lunar Rush.

In 2072, the United Nations passed regulations as to how land might be claimed and used, but these were largely ignored.

Unlike similar hemorrhagic fevers -ebola being the most famous- which occasionally effect the area, the Aso River Virus can be spread through casual contact, not simply via fluid exchange. This fact, along with a long, asymptomatic period of contagiousness, resulted in a pandemic which spread across most of Central Africa. It took two years for the virus to reduce the population to the point where it could no longer spread and eventually died off, during which time the rest of the world effectively quarantined much of the African Continent and left them to their fate. \n\n[[Return|01]]</div><div tiddler="0024-5507 Replica of Galileo Group Flag planted at Boreas Site" tags="" modified="201405241648" created="201405241648" modifier="twee">You open the drawer and the artifact within floats out of its own accord, expanding back into its original size and coming to rest on the ground in front of you. \n\nThe artifact is a flag on a thin metal pole.

Fearing that Mars would collapse into inter-colonial war if left ungoverned like the moon, the original settlers of Mars set in place a strict, some would say draconian, system of rule by which they and their descendants governed the planet for almost a century. This system was eventually replaced by a more open and free series of laws near the end of the 22nd century and the original Sword of Mars, long seen as the symbol of an often tyrannical rule, was exchanged for the Martian Sabre, a weapon which was said to represent the strength of Mars as a whole, ruler and subjects.

Lagos, a city of over 19 million people on the African Coast, was one of the first major cities to be effected by the virus and its government soon collapsed, leaving the citizens to fend for themselves. Gangs of armed looters soon formed and began to fight each other over the remaining resources while others fled into the surrounding wilderness to die of exposure or highjacked boats from the docks and sailed toward unknown shores, rarely to be heard from again. In his biography Bola Nzelibe, one of the few survivors from Lagos who spent much of his time hiding in the basement of a library, described it as follows:\n\n	“It seemed a hell to me; the sky was always dark with smoke, something always burning, tires, 	bodies or  buildings. The gangs fought for land at first, then food, then nothing. Little warlords rose 	and fell, bodies were lynched from streetlights as warnings for gangs that no longer existed, by 	gangs that no longer existed.  From the little windows near the ceiling I could see the city burning, 	black buildings in orange haze.

The Black Wall is a memorial site consisting of long wall upon which the names of those who died of the Aso River Virus were engraved or marked using burial tags.  The wall is divided into three sections, only the first of which is considered to have been constructed by the original builders. The original builders been lost to time,  unnamed Islamic missionaries who more than likely died of the same disease as the people they were memorializing. The original section of the black wall is about two meters tall and 35 meters long. It is constructed out of Gabbro slabs, the origin of which are unknown. The names engraved on this original section are believed to be limited to casualties of Lagos. The second section of the wall is constructed from much more varied materials, from concrete and sheet metal to wood and even plastic. Rather than engraving names into the wall itself, names in the section section were carved onto tags like this one and affixed to the wall. \n\nThe second section of the wall appears to have been started sometime after construction of the original ended. Unlike the first section, which seems to have been the work of a small group of coordinated individuals, the second section is the work hundreds without any clear organizing force. The second section of the wall is the ramshackle work of missionaries who would record the names of the dead and  memorialize them when they again pass near the wall. The second section of the wall is several hundred meters long and contains nearly a million names, some written on tags no larger than a bottle cap. The third and final section of the wall resembles the original section and was completed during the reconstruction period. It contains the names of anymore who were confirmed dead after the end of the African plague. In all, the Black wall is nearly 600 meters long and contains close to 3 million names, or roughly 4% of  all those who died. \n\nThis tag was removed from the wall when it was discovered to be a duplicate. \n\n[[Return|02]]\n</div><div tiddler="Censer Info" tags="" modified="201405241828" created="201405241828" modifier="twee">.&gt; A Roman Catholic Censer, created using scrap metal and used by refugees of war torn Europe during their time on Ceres.\n\n[[Return|01]]</div><div tiddler="0024-1475 WHO virologist clean-suit" tags="" modified="201405241633" created="201405241633" modifier="twee">You open the drawer and the artifact within floats out of it's own accord, expanding back into it's original size and hovering just in front of you.\n\nIt's a full body suit, bright yellow, made out of some sort of thick plastic with heavy black boots and gloves.

A flag from one of the old Earth nations, along with a corporate logo, is printed on the floor of the buggy, partially obscured by the seats. The buggy is about as basic as vehicles come;  a flat metal frame with 4 wheels, a motor, and a set of chairs that aren't much more than an aluminum frame with strips of some sort of synthetic fabric stretched across it. The motor, which sits behind the chairs, squatting on the rear axle, is completely unadorned and uncovered, simply bolted to the chassis. its hard to say if the vehicle was the result of an intensive project which stripped it of all unnecessary things, or if it was thrown together in a weekend by a few bored engineers using spare parts.

The chairs are rather uncomfortable- clearly designed for a man in a suit with a PLSS backpack on, meaning the back rest is pushed too far back, forcing you to slouch- but functional. The controls for the driver are quite different from the norm: There's no break or gas pedal, no steering wheel either. Everything seems to be handed by a joystick mounted next to the driver side chair, and the joystick itself has only two buttons, which you assume is gas and break. Judging by the position and set up, the suits the men in this vehicle must have worn were very ungainly and restrictive, making it difficult to do something as simple as turn a wheel or accurately press down a pedal. \n\nThe images printed on the floor of the vehicle are of a flag and a corporate logo. The flag, a set of horizontal stripes in black, red and yellow, is one you don't recognize. The logo is a stylized cornucopia  with a hydrogen molecule emerging from it.

It feels like tissue paper in your hands, so light and brittle that it might crumble to dust at any moment. The cover was cut away from the magazine rather inexpertly, the cut line wobbles back and forth rather than staying straight. There are small dog ears on each corner for some reason, and the advertisement on the reverse side has been damaged by someone placing and then removing tape from it. \n\nThe cover image has clearly been doctored, but you recognize the original. its Samuel Ridgemore's Luna, a photograph taken in the late 2040's that became famous after running as part of a publicity campaign for the founding of Tranquility. It was one of the most recognizable images of the time, and shows up amongst many other artifacts you've seen. \n\n[[&quot;Info&quot;|Time Info]]\n[[Return|02]]</div><div tiddler="Buddha's Smile Info" tags="" modified="201405241822" created="201405241822" modifier="twee">.&gt; The Buddha Smile, created by the former Chinese martian colony of Distant Kowloon, was considered to be the first interplanetary warship created by mankind. Although its offensive capacities-consisting mainly of a payload of high yield nuclear missiles- were dwarfed by many orbital weapons platforms, its capacity to travel to travel from mars to the Asteroid colonies, the Moon or even Earth made it an object of much fear upon its creation.\n\n[[Return|01]]</div><div tiddler="Missionary Info" tags="" modified="201405242122" created="201405242122" modifier="twee">.&gt; During the Aso River Virus pandemic of 2096-98, Islamic missionaries from northern Africa and the Middle East migrated into Central Africa as part of an effort to help the infected, many of whom were also Muslim. Although they were not alone in this effort -Catholic missionaries and various aid organizations as well as the World Health Organization were also present- they were by far the majority. The reasons for this particularly strong response are unknown, but it is believed that many considered such actions equal to Martyrdom, thus guaranteeing them a place in paradise. \n\n[[Return|03]]</div><div tiddler="0024-5437 Sphinx Observatory Image B00434" tags="" modified="201405241648" created="201405241648" modifier="twee">You open the drawer and the artifact within floats out of its own accord, expanding back into its original size and hovering just in front of you. \n\nThe artifact is a digital image, which the database displays as a poster sized, perfectly flat photograph in front of you.

The jacket and pants are made of the same rugged looking materials, and appear to be part of a set. They look like the clothes of a construction worker or mechanic: simple, sturdy, and designed to provide a minimal level of protection. The shirt under the jacket is a t-shirt with stripes of color matching the French flag...or is it Italian? They're very similar if you remember right. The hat is a modified bike helmet, which has been altered to include a fabric mask that covers the face and neck of the wearer. \n\nThe other objects which came with the suit are a folding knife, a bottle of spray paint, a metal bottle of lighter fluid- judging by the design on it- and an aluminum baseball bat that's been modified by welding long slices of thick metal sheeting onto it to form what amounts to an elongated flanged mace. \n\n[[&quot;Info&quot;|Loyalist Info]]\n[[Return|01]]</div><div tiddler="0024-8758 Lunar Habitation Stack blue print" tags="" modified="201405241657" created="201405241657" modifier="twee">You open the drawer and the artifact within floats out of its own accord, expanding back into its original size and hovering just in front of you. \n\nThe artifact inside is strange; its the digital blueprint of a habitation area.

The dress is either made of or interwoven with some sort of reactive fiberoptic or luminous fiber that responds to the movements of the cloth. The warm, looking vaguely golden fabric combined with the soft amber of the lights makes it appear as though the dress is constructed of rippling sunlight or flowing gold. It's quite beautiful.  \n\nThe second artifact, the image, depicts a young, very skinny, dark skinned woman with bright blue eye shadow  and a shaved head.

The city, constructed by survivors and Islamic missionaries, was considered unimportant in terms economic or political power, but attracted a great deal of attention from the global community. While many feared it would serve as a new stronghold for the increasingly militant Islamic forces of the middle east, it quickly became a center of learning, trade and art, a bastion of civilization amidst the burnt, scarred earth of inner Africa. Its creation is considered by some historians to be the catalyst for the second Islamic golden age,  otherwise known as the Wayfarer Spring. \n\n[[Return|02]]</div><div tiddler="0024-8947 “Bobby” Law enforcement suit" tags="" modified="201405241658" created="201405241658" modifier="twee">You open the drawer and the artifact within floats out of its own accord, expanding back into its original size and hovering just in front of you. \n\nThe artifact is a suit of protective gear with “POLICE” printed across the chest and the back of the shoulders.
