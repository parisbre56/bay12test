						<div class="inner" id="msg_2777219">You are a Necromancer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is very likely to get you killed.<br /><br />More than a thousand years ago, the great Necromancer Balkoth warred across the world, using his terrible magic to conquer and ravage, obliterating any opponent that stood in his way. Like many similar stories, this one ends with an unlikely band of heroes rising up to slay him in battle and end his reign of tyranny, or some such. You never did pay as much attention to your teachers as you should have. The pertinent information from that particular lesson was that no nation on Urak will suffer a Necromancer to live, lest he once again shatter the nations.<br /><br />It&#039;s not that you <em>wanted </em>to be a necromancer, exactly. When you were born, the sages remarked on your great potential, but when the Time of Testing came you failed to manifest the Powers of your People. Er, who are your people again?<br /><br /><br /><strong>You are one of the Elves of Yicelafo, &quot;The Young Vale.&quot;</strong> Elves have greater magical potential than other races, and are specially attuned to their surroundings, but between the immortality and the cremating there aren&#039;t many corpses just kick&#039;n around. Elves have little knowledge of history and their Mages wield the power of <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Life</strong></span> to heal, renew, and grow.<br /><br /><strong>You are a human of Thrimesdur, &quot;The Cremated Empire.&quot;</strong> The Empire is old, and its libraries hold the knowledge of the ancients (which may be invaluable in harnessing your burgeoning Necromantic powers.) Plus, between the ancient battlefields, mass graveyards, and well-preserved crypts, there are a LOT of corpses to be getting on with! The Wizards of Thrimesdur specialize in manipulating the forces of <strong>Order</strong> for divination and protective magics.<br /><br /><strong>You are a human living on the Jeweled Coast.</strong> Like most living in the coastal villages of the Sapphire Sea, you have a penchant for stealth, and the independent city-states are centers of trade; magical items and scrolls can be found here more easily than anywhere else. Most towns bury their dead at sea, but many of the larger cities have extensive catacombs and ornate mausoleums for the wealthy and powerful. The predominant Faith is the worship of the elemental force of <strong><span style="color: navy;" class="bbc_color">Water</span></strong>, and the Mystics use this power in a variety of ways.<br /><br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Author&#039;s note</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">Yep, a suggestion game.

That said, some actions have unpredictable forces at work (especially combat,) so listed here is a general format for handling those situations.<br /><br />If an action has a significant luck-based component, then a d12 is rolled. The result is interpreted based on the difficulty of the task- a 3 would be the threshold for an Easy task, 6 for Moderate, 9 for Difficult and 12 for Professionals only. For example, trying to catch a fish is a Moderately difficult task. Rivers that have loads of fish (e.g salmon run) might be Easy, while fishing with inadequate equipment or in inhospitable locales might be Difficult or even Professional. Applicable modifiers are factored in- a Competent Fisher would get a +2 bonus for skill, and if they had special bait or equipment they might get another +1.<br /><br />This only applies if the character is trying to accomplish the task in a comparatively brief period of time- the above scenario might play out if the character only had an hour to catch a fish before nightfall. If the character has plenty of time (all day, for example) then the general format devolves back to narrative logic- if you are fishing with a +2 bonus, you&#039;re bound to catch something sooner or later. The difficulty chart may be used as a rough &quot;can you or can&#039;t you&quot; guide- after all, only a Fisher with skill is going to be able to surpass the Professional threshold. <br /><br /><span class="bbc_u"><strong>Combat</strong></span><br /><br />Combat is a little different- instead of one roll, there is an opposed roll between the attacker and defender. If the attacker&#039;s roll + modifiers exceeds the defender&#039;s roll + modifiers, then the attack hits and damage is dealt. If the attacker rolls a natural 12, then the attack is a Critical Hit. It automatically hits, and in addition it also damages a specific body part based on damage type, which tends to impose a debuff or other critical situation.<br /><br />The amount and type of damage dealt is determined by weapon choice, and can be modified by the defender&#039;s equipment. For example, slashing damage is less effective against foes with stone skin, or plate armor, but would be more effective against spider webs. Some weapons have secondary damage types- Swords are primarily piercing or slashing weapons, but you can always try to bludgeon somebody with the pommel or flat of the blade. In that case, you&#039;d suffer a small attack penalty and would deal less damage (specifically for this example, as a club.) Weapons and armor often have other special qualities or abilities, denoted by their description in the Equipment spoiler.<br /><br /><strong>As a brief example</strong>, Nym the Neophyte Necromancer stabs Urist McDwarf with her Dagger. [11]vs[8]- a success! Daggers deal 1d4 damage, and the Dwarf takes [2] damage. However, Daggers also have a special property- they crit on an 11 AND a 12. Daggers deal either Piercing or Slashing damage- since Nym did not specify, it is randomly determined that she Slashed the dwarf&#039;s Leg with her attack. The dwarf has difficulty moving around, receiving a penalty to defense and movement rate, <del>and is more difficult to Zombify to full health</del>.<br /><br />Opposed rolls are not just limited to combat- they are also used wherever an actions success is dependent on another being&#039;s actions. Successfully lying would be an example, or the outcome of a chess match. General diplomacy is <em>not </em>an example, since I&#039;ll be asking you to actually convince the NPC&#039;s rather than letting dice do it.<br /><br />You get the idea, and I reserve the right to deviate from this without warning.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Equipment</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">Prices may vary by availability<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br />Bedroll- 1sp<br />Trail Rations- 0.5sp per day&#039;s worth<br />Hatchet- 6sp<br />Rope Reed Fiber Rope- 0.2sp per 5 feet<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Magic Items</span><br />Crystal- 20sp/oz (1oz is equivalent to 1 Mana stored in a potion)<br />Empty Potion bottle- 1sp<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2865035#msg2865035" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Writing Materials</a></span><br />Ink- 8sp per 1oz vial<br />Charcoal- 0.1sp per 10 sticks<br />Chalk- 0.1sp per 10 sticks<br />Scroll Case- 1sp<br />Paper- 0.4sp per sheet (unavailable in Vale)<br />Rope Reed Papyrus- 0.4sp per sheet (0.8 outside Vale)<br />Parchment- 0.2sp per sheet<br />Wax Tablet- 1sp<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Weapons</span><br />Shortbow- 30sp - 1d6 Damage, <abbr title="Penalty for attacks at longer than this, cumulative per increment">Range Increment of 60ft</abbr>, double damage on crit, Piercing<br />Dagger- 2sp (4 in Vale) - 1d4 Damage, crits on 11/12, Piercing/Slashing<br />Shortsword- 10sp - 1d6 Damage, crits on 11/12, Piercing/Slashing<br />Masterwork Elven Staff- 1d6 damage, extra +1 attack and damage due to masterwork quality, Bludgeoning<br />Shortspear- 1d6 damage, can be thrown ~20ft, Piercing<br /></div></div></div>

						<div class="inner" id="msg_2777928">Ah yes, you are an Elf of Yicelafo, &quot;The Young Vale.&quot; Like all elven children, when you were young you were evaluated for suitability in one of the Guilds. The Mages found that you had surprisingly deep wells of magical power, but although you easily mastered the cantrips learned by all Elves you struggled to grasp even the basics of the Way of Life. The Rangers determined that although you were capable of handling yourself in the woods of the Vale, you lacked the physical gifts to be a suitable candidate for the defense of the forest. And as the Sages quickly found out, you lack the patience and demeanor to be an effective scribe or bard.<br /><br />You never felt comfortable in your various apprenticeships, and never settled down to master a craft. As time went on, you found yourself drawn to solitary pursuits, and came to become a fair Fisher. Life was pleasant, for a time. But as you approached adulthood, you began to feel... strange. You&#039;d awake in the night in a cold sweat, your Mana depleted. You&#039;d experience the oddest headaches, and sometimes it felt as though all the life around you burned with a cold inner fire.<br /><br />Today had been a fairly normal day- you&#039;d gone to your private fishing hole, a small pond on the edges of the Vale that fed into the Great River. You&#039;d already caught a nice large trout, leaving it to air-drown while you continued fishing. As midday approached, you decided to take a brief lunch break, but when you reached to pick up the fish a small purple spark flashed from you to it, and the trout started flopping along the ground, eyes glowing with purple, phosphorescent flames. You promptly passed out.<br /><br />Now you are awake, and the trout zombie is placidly swimming about the pool. You&#039;ll have to deal with your new powers sooner or later- you could try to figure things out yourself (and you&#039;ll certainly have to, to some degree,) but you have little knowledge of the methods or hazards involved. You could try to ask the Mages in the village some general questions about magic, but you&#039;ll have to be careful not to give yourself away. The local Sage is a garrulous old elf, and with a bit of prompting you could get him to tell stories of other Necromancers who have arisen (or tried to, at least) since the Golgothan War- their lives might hold clues to mastering your Power. Perhaps most extremely, you could set out to the large cities of Man in an attempt to find Necromantic scrolls or magical items to learn from. Or maybe there&#039;s another way, a better way, if you can but think of it.<br /><br />Whatever you do, you must make sure nobody discovers your... talents. If they do, you will be hunted down and killed by the ruthlessly efficient Elven Rangers. And you&#039;ll also have to decide what to <em>do</em>, exactly, with your powers. World conquest seems like a popular theme (according to the songs, anyway,) but surely there&#039;s another use for a nigh-infinite supply of cheap labor!<br /><br />It is midafternoon. <strong>What now?</strong><br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Author&#039;s Note</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">When playing with your Necromantic powers, please be specific.

Displaying the cunning of your elvish ancestors you stalk the magnificent creature. As it alights on a flower, you sneak up and... SPLAT! Belatedly, you realize you probably need a more intact corpse than the smear of butterfly goo you&#039;ve produced.<br /><br />Some further searching yields an anthill, and you settle down to experiment. What you rapidly discover is that it is hard to kill an insect without squashing it. Ripping off their legs doesn&#039;t seem to be killing them very fast. You behead one and wait for it to stop squirming, then bring your will to bear.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><strong><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font">Raise Dead.</span></strong></span></span><br /><br />An icy shock runs through your body as you feel energy rush through you and into the ant. The ant rises to its feet, a cold purple flame where its head once was. It begins to shamble aimlessly.<br /><br />You are surprised at how much Mana that consumed- 2 units! Surely it should take less energy to raise a mere ant than a great big fish!

There will be precious little sympathy for your situation- when Balkoth brought the Golgothan War to the Sacred Groves, he butchered every elf he caught and put the woods to the torch. You know the Elves were nearly driven to extinction in that clash- you&#039;ll have to ask Pevo Zephyrtempest, the village Sage, for more information there. <br /><br />You&#039;ve drifted apart from your friends in recent years, but you still speak with your best friend, Omo Thunderjaw, whenever you see him. That hasn&#039;t been often of late, as he is training with the Rangers, though he is home now. You think he&#039;d take risks on your behalf, provided he wasn&#039;t aware of the specifics. Your mother is a successful Mage and spends her time in the tree-city of Yicelafo proper, and your father is a lieutenant of the Rangers himself, often patrolling the edges of the Vale. You&#039;d like to think you could tell them anything. You&#039;ve never taken a serious lover, apart from that fling with Elana Foundwasps- in fact, the end of that relationship is when you began withdrawing from society... and when the onset of your powers began, you realize. She&#039;s training to be a Mage now, manipulating the magics of Life.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2778101#msg2778101">Quote from: woose1 on Tue 22-11-2011, 06:58:07</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2778043#msg2778043">Quote from: Grek on Tue 22-11-2011, 06:38:21</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">The very first order of business, of course, is to <strong>capture</strong> or, failing that, rekill <strong>the fish that you just revived</strong>. We cannot afford for it to escape into the Great River and wash downstream for someone to find. That would be an utter disaster.<br /><br />Once you&#039;ve got the fish, take it somewhere isolated (where it can&#039;t escape into a major river; perhaps in a bucket?) and study it. See if it moves like a normal fish, if it breathes water, what (if anything) it eats, whether we can command it, if it is still rotting, if it is any more agressive than a natural trout and so on and so forth. Use each cantrip on the undead fish and compare to what you know of natural fish.<br /><br />Once you&#039;ve figured out how the fish works, take Mullet&#039;s suggestion of trying out different sorts of fish and work with those. There&#039;s no need to make any rash decisions about what to do and where to go immediately. See if you can&#039;t work out how to reliably revive fish when you want and how to keep yourself from using necromancy by accident. Let&#039;s puzzle out what we can for now and decide the rest later, with better information.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This. And after, if we&#039;re still hungry, eat the zombie trout.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You notice that the zombie trout is very easy to spot, what with the glowing purple eyes and all. Panicking, you splash into the pond to recapture it! You notice it does not flee you the way the other fish do, and soon you have it back on dry land. Setting it down, it flops about like any other fish would, albeit less enthusiastically. Nudging it away with your foot you wait a minute, two minutes, five... it appears the fish no longer needs water to survive. You attempt to discern whether it is still decomposing, but in vain- it has been dead only a few hours, after all.<br /><br />Carefully, you walk back into the water with it, observing it as it swims. It certainly doesn&#039;t appear interested in you, nor does it appear to be interested in any other of the pond&#039;s inhabitants. The other fish do seem to avoid your zombie, however. As it lazily swims to the other side of the pond, you attempt to recall it mentally, to no avail. &quot;Here, zombie zombie zombie...&quot; doesn&#039;t do you much good either.<br /><br />Retrieving the fish manually, you set down on the shore and begin to test it with your cantrips. <strong>Detect Magic</strong> indicates that this is indeed a magical fish- further, you can feel the ant a bit further off. Remembering the ant, you leap to your feet and set off to crush it before it gets away from you! You find it beset by the other ants- it vivisects another as you watch, and judging by the bodies it has singlehandedly destroyed half a dozen others. As you watch it is swarmed under by the other ants; the purple fire goes out as it is cut in two, and the body is carried back to the anthill.<br /><br />Returning to your inspection of the fish, you feel your <strong>Calm Animal</strong> spell rebound, as if you had cast it on a tree or another elf. You then cast <strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- the fish registers, but strangely. It feels rather as if the fish&#039;s vitality is not its own. Focusing on a trout on the far side of the pond, you cast the spell again- by your reckoning, your zombie has almost half the vitality of the living trout. <br /><br />You decide you&#039;ve learned what you can from this trout for now- after all, if necessary you can always catch another fish. You fancifully entertain the notion of <em>eating </em>the fish- after a moment, the fancy turns into curiosity. You set to butchering the fish, a task made much more difficult what with it flopping around everywhere. Once you have extracted the fish&#039;s guts, the purple phosphorescence fades from its eyes. You pause for a moment, then conclude your cleaning of the fish.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2777937#msg2777937">Quote from: Mullet Master on Tue 22-11-2011, 05:46:03</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You have had success with fish, but it is draining. Perhaps something smaller is afoot. Using your fishing ability, it would be best to catch many small creatures of the pond, such as crawfish, minnows, and other small fish. They can be easily transported... DEAD, back to a private place.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You realize that your pond is by no means a private place- everyone who knows you knows to find you here. You resolve to catch as many small creatures as you can to experiment on later, in some more private place. An hour or so later you&#039;ve managed to catch a dozen of the crayfish that abound in the pond- easy enough to pass them off as fishbait should anyone wonder what you&#039;re doing with a pouch full of the critters. <br /><br />You&#039;ll have to search for a new place to practice tomorrow, however. You return home at sunset, nodding to the other villagers as you make your way to your parents home. You have the place to yourself now since both of them are gone. For dinner, you decide to cook up your formerly zombified fish- to your tongue, it tastes no different than a normal fish. You sleep peacefully through the night, and awaken fresh in the morning.<br /><br />You plan to find a new, private place to practice your arts. You could travel North, further into the woods and try to find a secluded glen. Traveling East would bring you upriver- there may be a more private little branch or creek there. Traveling South would bring you to the cliffs that contain the Vale- perhaps there is a cave there. Or should you question the elders before you leave today?<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">Vitality- 10/10<br />Mana- 10/10<br />XP= 2/10<br />Inventory- <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Conceals your nakedness most admirably">Elven Tunic</abbr></span>, Belt Knife, Pouch(6 dead crayfish)<br />Status- Content<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - you can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Necromancy</span><br />You don&#039;t have much control of your powers, but you lost 2 mana bringing that fish back AND raising the ant.

When the time comes that you can make no further progress here, either due to lack of materials or being unable to learn more without resources to study, tell the village (and any humans that ask about you) that that you are departing for Thrimesdur to study the history of the Cremated Empire. This provides a legitimate excuse for you to be wandering ancient battlefields, studying in libraries and exploring abandoned tombs. Who would suspect a mild-mannered elven scholar with little proficency in magic to be a necromancer?<br /><br />There&#039;s no need to set out right away, of course. That would look suspicious. Instead, split your time between experimenting in private with necromancy (I&#039;m sure the others will have all sorts of suggestions for things to try) and <strong>ask</strong>ing <strong>around about the history of Thrimesdur</strong>. Pevo, your mother, Elana, whoever might know about history. Take good notes and occasionally hint at wanting to go see the world and study abroad. You can work out the rest laster.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Ignore my suggestion. This is better.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Seconded and maybe if we take the job as an librarian we can earn some money on the side &lt;.&lt; &gt;.&gt;<br />I played to much adom....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As you munch on <abbr title="crusty Whip Vine Bread with fresh Fisher berries and some goat&#039;s milk">a wholesome breakfast</abbr>, you devise a plan. Over the next few days and weeks you&#039;ll express a keen interest in ancient history, especially that of Thrimesdur. You are a bit young for such a venture, but wanderlust is not unknown among the Elves and your people are on exceedingly good terms with Thrimesdur- their caravans are the only humans allowed through The Walled Jungles, on their journey to the Jeweled Coast.<br /><br />The plan has its merits- it will be easier to practice your Necromantic arts in the vast stretches of wilderness in The Cremated Empire, the great libraries of that nation may hold further clues to the Necromantic art and the secrets of the ancient Necromancers, and there&#039;s plenty of old battlefields and tombs to explore for artifacts and... test subjects, let&#039;s say? Your biggest hurdles will be getting permission to leave the Vale and gathering the supplies to sustain yourself on such a journey. You are confidant you can wear down the Elders given time (and the influence of your mother,) and although you don&#039;t have any money (preferring to fish for self-sufficiency and doing odd tasks for incidentals) it shouldn&#039;t be too hard to earn the money, one way or another.<br /><br />But first things first! You head to the heart of the hamlet, cordially greeting the elves you pass, a smile here, a wave there. In good spirits, you arrive at the Temple of Aye Valleymists, the elven deity associated with Life, the Forest, and Rivers. The Temple is a bit larger than the other buildings of the hamlet- most homes are one or two room treehouses, built of deadwood and cunningly woven into the living branches. The Temple is much larger, comprising a dozen or more rooms spread throughout the branches of a massive oak tree. The Mage Ari Wetdawn is teaching a couple of young children the basics of Magic on the grass below the Temple.<br /><br />You watch as Ari guides them through a children&#039;s exercise, remembering when you yourself performed it. Ari and the children sit around a flower, eyes closed, hands outstretched. The flower is wreathed in <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">green</span> flames, with tendrils of gold twining about the leaves and stem. As you watch, the flower grows visibly healthier, taller, brighter. After a few moments, the lesson is concluded, and Ari dismisses the children, who promptly run off laughing. You approach Ari before he returns to the Temple interior.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I never understood the point of that exercise, Ari. They&#039;re too young to be manifesting any Life magic- why not stick to general magic?</span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">Ah, but this is one of the ways we determine who <em>will </em>manifest such talents! It&#039;s important to catch them at a young age, so we can teach them properly.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Why? What would happen if, say, they were learning magic on their own?</span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">Oh, a great many things could happen to the unwary practitioner. They could attempt a task beyond their capabilities, tapping too much of their Mana reserve, which could stunt their magical growth. Too, many of the more powerful Life spells require the caster to sacrifice some of his own Vitality- if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing, you could seriously hurt or even kill yourself.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I had no idea it was that risky.</span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">Oh, it isn&#039;t so common a threat as that- Life magics sometimes surface among the humans, where they don&#039;t have a Life Mage handy to recognize the early signs, but they rarely die of the gift before others realize what is happening.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">How can non-Mages recognize the gift, Ari?</span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">The signs get much more obvious- if they don&#039;t realize what is going on, they begin to spontaneously cast Life spells due to Mana buildup. Plants start blooming out of season, people nearby are cured of their ills, so on and so forth. Sooner or later they put two and two together and send the young Mage to us for tutelage.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">What&#039;s Mana buildup?</span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">When your magical ability is growing, it requires exercise, same as your muscles, or your mind. You seem full of questions today.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Oh, I&#039;ve just been thinking, and discovering I have few new thoughts to think- I want to hear new things, see new places. I&#039;m beginning to wish I had paid more attention to the Sages as a child. Speaking of, have you seen Pevo Zephyrtempest about?</span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">I&#039;m afraid not, young one- I believe he was visiting family a few villages over. He should be back tomorrow, if you wish to see him. I hope you&#039;ll excuse me, magical business to attend to, you know how it is.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Thank you for your time, Ari Wetdawn.</span></strong><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2778717#msg2778717">Quote from: Dwarmin on Tue 22-11-2011, 15:26:11</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yeah, can we not just disappear into a cave somewhere, yet? <img src="./Necromancer/7.gif" alt="&#58;P" title="Tongue" class="smiley" /><br /><br />I agree-lets make ourselves a respectable Historian.

Is there still anything between us? <br /><br />As for experiments, I suggest seeing if we can animate dead plants as well as animals and insects.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You feel pretty good about this morning, and head home for a quick <abbr title="a bit of trout and some Whip Vine Wine, nothing fancy">lunch</abbr>. You find yourself reminiscing about Elana Foundwasps- you had some good times, until she left you. In truth, you were envious of her Power, Power you had thought to possess, and she had lacked the patience and understanding to deal with your childish jealousy. It&#039;s easy to recognize now, with the passage of time and the discovery of your own Power. She had begun her formal training not long after your breakup, and you haven&#039;t spoken since.<br /><br />Perhaps, you think to yourself, perhaps this is a relationship worth resurrecting in one form or another. After all, she&#039;s a magic-user on the rise, you&#039;re a young magic-user on the rise... not that you can really <em>tell </em>her you are, but still. Even if you can&#039;t recapture the way things used to be, it could be a good idea to chat with somebody else who is mastering the arcane arts, somebody with competent teachers. It could be that some of the techniques she is learning would transfer, and it never hurts to have friends in high places.<br /><br />A week ago, you might have had this thought and let it languish, but this is a new you, a You that gets things done! You grab a quill and inkpot, a short length of scroll and a parchment envelope, and write Elana a letter. Nothing too forward, familiar without being intimate, inquisitive, how-do-you-do. Your words certainly sound more mature than the <em>last </em>thing you said to her, anyway- maybe it&#039;s enough. With some small measure of chagrin, you realize that midday is a very poor time to mail a letter- everyone who would be heading that direction is already gone, and you don&#039;t have the means to pay somebody to deliver it. Not to worry- you can mail it on the morrow.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2778213#msg2778213">Quote from: woose1 on Tue 22-11-2011, 07:52:44</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><del><strong>Inquire about any old books that might detail the processes of old, forgotten magic.

You decide to head south, towards the cliffs that line the Vale. After a few hours walk through the woods, you find yourself facing those cliffs. The trees grow right up to the cliff-face; the cliff itself is rough enough that some hardy trees have taken root in the side. The entire face is rather craggy, riddled with gullies and depressions.<br /><br />For no particular reason, you decide to follow the cliff-face East, looking for someplace that can easily be made private. You pass several shallow caves, more overhangs than any place to hide from prying eyes. After about an hours walk, you find just the thing- a nice deep cave, the entrance screened by a veil of vines, not easily visible to passersby!<br /><br />Unfortunately, you also find a bear.<br /><br />Fortunately, you know this bear- every elf knows Apasi Adoredbear, an aging black bear often seen out and about the Vale. Like most animals of the wood, Apasi does not fear the presence of Elves, and will even tolerate them in near proximity. You doubt, however, that Apasi will easily suffer the presence of an elf in his very den. He is sleeping right now- <strong>what will you do?</strong><br /><br /><br />[And wow, it took me until dialogue occurred to realize I never asked You <strong>what your name is?</strong> You can vote gender as well, I suppose- don&#039;t know what it&#039;ll affect, but why the hell not.

That said, they&#039;re still wild animals and not likely to be keen on you messing around in their dens. The Calm Animal spell makes animals not hostile and lasts for a good day. Elves cannot innately communicate with animals, but there are Life spells that would allow them to do so, in limited fashion- most animals aren&#039;t much on the whole &quot;language&quot; thing. For that reason, chatting with the wildlife isn&#039;t exactly an idle pursuit.<br /><br />Anywho, amend suggestions as you see fit- I may or may not update tonight, and I almost certainly won&#039;t update tomorrow (happy turkey day fellow Americans, happy Thursday everyone else!)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2781458#msg2781458">Quote from: Dwarmin on Wed 23-11-2011, 15:41:03</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I was sort of hoping we could be the nameless Necromancer.

With little difficulty, you find an elf preparing to commute to Elana&#039;s village, and convince him to carry your letter for you. Assuming she writes back, it&#039;ll probably arrive in the next day or so.<br /><br />That chore taken care of, you head back to the Temple. You recognize the distinctive silhouette of Pevo Zephyrtempest approaching the Temple- he suffered a bad injury many years ago, and now walks only with the aid of his cane. The cane is something of a novelty among the elves- you&#039;ve never heard of an injury the Life Mage&#039;s couldn&#039;t heal, even that time the Ranger&#039;s arm was mangled days away from the Vale. As you approach, Pevo greets you warmly.<br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Hello, young one! Ari told me you were looking for me!</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Indeed, Pevo- I&#039;ve been wanting to learn more about the things beyond the Vale, and a knowledge of history seemed like a good place to start.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">A scholar in the making, eh? Very well, what would you like me to tell you about?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Well, for a start, how about Thrimesdur? I don&#039;t know much about them, other than their close friendship with the Elves.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Hah! If I wanted to fill your head with all my considerable knowledge about the people of The Cremated Empire, we&#039;d be standing here for quite some time! Well, you can&#039;t properly begin discussing who people are without discussing where they come from- come with me.</span><br /><br />With that, Pevo climbs the rope reed ladder into the temple with surprising agility. You hasten to follow, up ladders, through small shrines and storage rooms, and across bridges until you come to a small room nestled in the higher branches- Pevo&#039;s study. As Pevo hangs up his cloak, you examine your surroundings. Pevo&#039;s study is crammed with odd devices that are strange to you (and judging by the tacked-on notes, strange to Pevo as well!) Assorted knick-knacks, empty glass bottles, and piles upon piles of paper, parchment, vellum, scrolls and tablets fill every surface. But your eye is immediately drawn to a massive map that occupies the entire South wall of the study.<br /><br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Is that... Urak?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Hah! That, young one, is but a fraction of Urak&#039;s totality- it is all we know of with any certainty, though we have much speculation and rumor about further lands. It is certainly enough to be getting on with, at any rate. Here- those red marks are the major cities of the Jeweled Coast. As you can see, the Walled Jungles run right up to the coast. That yellow mark is Yicelafo. Thrimesdur&#039;s borders run from the Great River clear to the Black Swamps, home of the Golgothans</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><em>That </em>little thing is the Great River? That other river is nearly twice as long!</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Oh, and size matters so much, does it? The Great River is so named not because of its size, but because of its inhabitants- the principal cities of Thrimesdur lie on its banks.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">It looks as though most of Thrimesdur is empty, by this map.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Empty of anything of political significance, certainly. Much of the Cremated Empire is wilderness, true, but much of that &quot;empty space&quot; is farmland and small villages, castles and caravan towns. The Emperor is able to control such remote marches through his strict adherence to the ways of <strong>Order</strong>.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Order is one of the magical faiths, isn&#039;t it? How many are there?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">It is, it is- <strong><span style="color: black;" class="bbc_color">Order </span></strong>is one of what are called the Derived Magics. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Chaos</strong></span> is another, practiced by many of the monstrous races as well as the Horse-Lords of the north. <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Life </strong></span>is another of the Derived Magics. <span style="color: navy;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Water </strong></span>is one of the Elemental Magics, and is common along the Jeweled Coast. Water&#039;s opposite is <span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Fire</strong></span>- the Fire Giants once lived in the mountains north of Thrimesdur, but they were betrayed by the Golgothans and exterminated. Some few dwarves still keep that faith alive, but most follow the ways of <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Earth</strong></span>. <strong><span style="color: cyan;" class="bbc_color">Air</span></strong> is opposed to Earth, and is practiced by some of the Horse-Lords, as well as the mountain-dwelling Pixies and the odd Frost Giant. There used to be quite the number of Elves who knew the art of Air-magic, but they all perished in the Golgothan War. None have ever risen amongst our people again.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">The Golgothans... Life&#039;s opposite.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Yes, the Golgothans were worshipers of <strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Death</span></strong>- whereas the Mages of Life have the power to enhance the Vitality, the Life-Force of living things, the Necromancers had the power to take that Vitality and give it to the Dead.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">That area between Thrimesdur and the Dwarven Lands- what is that?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">...that place was once the Sacred Grove, home to all Elvenkind. It is a wasteland now, unfit for the living- the Necromancers saw to that. Many Elves died in the defense of their homeland there, died in vain, and the Necromancers were able to use that fact to devastating effect. We&#039;d have gone the way of the Fire Giants if it were not for the intercession of Thrimesdur. Thrimesdur&#039;s sons died protecting the flight of the Elven refugees, women and children sent away should the worst come to pass, as it did. A remnant of a remnant, ushered through strange human lands to this new forest, this new home.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">That is why our alliance with the Cremated Empire is so strong, isn&#039;t it?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Yes. Ah, when I think of how much was lost in the Golgothan War... our history, our culture, our knowledge. Our magic, too- nearly all the Mages died defending the Sacred Groves, and the knowledge of their spells died with them. It is said we could do so much more then than we can now- regenerate lost limbs, cure any disease, even resurrect the dead.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Wait, resurrect the dead? Isn&#039;t that Necromancy?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Well, no, but I&#039;ll admit I&#039;m not clear on the particulars there. I suspect it&#039;s rather a matter of technique- Ari Wetdawns would know more. But I suppose I&#039;ve talked your ear off enough- I have a class to teach! Feel free to come back and chat any time.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I certainly will- thank you for your time, Pevo Zephyrtempest.</span><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2782734#msg2782734">Quote from: Hitty40 on Thu 24-11-2011, 02:36:07</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I say <strong>Cutrib Briskt</strong> <strong>leaves the bear alone</strong> so <strong>he</strong> can <strong>mingle with some of the villagers, maybe learn something.</strong><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As you take your leave of Pevo, you absently note that it is nearing noon- you&#039;re a bit preoccupied with Pevo&#039;s words to care overmuch. Although there is a great deal to compete for your attention, for some reason one phrase keeps niggling at the back of your mind- <span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">You can&#039;t properly begin discussing who people are without discussing where they come from.</span> Who <em>are </em>you, and where do you come from? You&#039;re an Elf, but what exactly is an Elf? What makes your people so different from all those peoples on Pevo&#039;s map?<br /><br />Chuckling to yourself, you decide to take Pevo at his word- you&#039;ll find out by learning about where they come from, both the history of your people and the way they live every day! Since Pevo is otherwise occupied, you decide to do some odd chores around the village- it is the type of thing you&#039;ve done countless times in the past, but never before have you really paid attention the way you are now.<br /><br />You chop some firewood for Caraca Overbud, laughing as her children chase each other about the tree. You help Salore Brimsdusk repair the roof of his house, admiring the aesthetic sensitivity he imparts to an otherwise trivial task. You chuckle as Mawada Drinkgrowths squabbles with his neighbor Temiyi Oarblazes over some percieved slight or another, and laugh when the latter steals a fresh-baked pie from under his nose. You help haul some furniture for Iru Squeezedskirt, watching with no small measure of amusement as he courts the attentions of Iki Canyonbites- he&#039;s been pursuing her for years, and while she hasn&#039;t said yes to him yet, she hasn&#039;t said no, either.<br /><br />There is nothing new in the Vale, nothing the historians would write about. There is just the gentle rhythm of life, to and fro, ebb and flow, anger flowing into laughter and back again with never a moment of malice or hate. The past is not the focus of the Elves, nor the is the future- the here and now is what matters to them.<br /><br />But then, you aren&#039;t like them, are you? You are a Necromancer.<br /><br />As the sun sets, you return to your home. You received both lunch and supper for your toils, as well as a <abbr title="Eight copper pieces">bit of money</abbr>. Tired, but content, you go to sleep, and <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">begin to dream...<br /><br />It is dark, and cramped, and cold. So cold... you feel frozen. You can&#039;t move. You feel a terrible need to be warm, and no sooner do you have the thought than you feel heat growing within you. It is trapped, you can feel it, you are incomplete. You force your will on your body, and suddenly the heat leaps out, bridging the incompleteness, making you whole. <br /><br />The heat flows out, suffusing your limbs- too many limbs. Where it meets discontinuities, holes, fuzziness, it flows around, replacing what is missing. Your legs twitch- your claws clench. Purple phosphorescence erupts from your eyes, and you can see! You are surrounded by horrible lobster-like creatures, staring at you with their dead eyes, burying you beneath their bodies! <br /><br />You try to flee, but can&#039;t! THEY ARE TOO HEAVY! <strong>THEY ARE HOLDING YOU DOWN AND YOU CAN&#039;T GET</strong></span> <em><strong>OUT</strong></em>! <br /><br />With a violent start, you awake in a cold sweat, the sound of rain drumming on the roof. Your head feels light as air, your mind tenuously tethered to your body. Nauseated, you look at your nightstand.

If successful, we should walk about briefly and see how well we can adapt ourselves to a temporary stay in the body of another.<br /><br />Once that&#039;s done, destroy the body, of course. There cannot be any evidence of our power, at least not yet.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Your first impulse is to destroy the crayfish, but you hesitate- the rain is loud, and by your reckoning it is still early morning. Few elves will be out and about at this hour, and this is an important opportunity to learn a thing or two about your powers. You decide to experiment, and see if you can control your unintentional creation.<br /><br />Lighting a candle, you reach over to your nightstand and pick up your pouch, spilling the contents onto the floor. The contents are starting to get rather rank- if you don&#039;t use them today you&#039;ll need to throw them away or find some other place to store them. Your idle thoughts are banished as the undead crayfish immediately makes a beeline for the door- reaching down, you scoop it up and set it back in the center of the room, only for it to scurry to the door again. Snatching a tunic off the floor, you line the bottom of the door, sealing off the crack to the outside. The crayfish, after, briefly exploring this new barrier, scuttles along the edge of the wall, feeling for a crack to slip through. Grabbing your belt pouch, you recapture the crayfish and sit back to think on this new complication.<br /><br />In your dream, you very much wanted to escape your prison. Could that impulse have persisted after you awoke? The pouch is flopping back and forth as the crayfish tries to find a way out. Clearing your mind, you try to mentally order the crayfish to be still. The flopping does not cease. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Stop that,&quot;</span>&nbsp; you hiss, with no apparent effect. It&#039;s the same as at the pond.<br /><br />Perhaps you&#039;re going about this wrong. You aren&#039;t trying to bend another thinking being to your will- in your dream, you <em>were </em>the crayfish. Once again, you clear your mind and focus your will- you remember how strange your extra limbs felt, the pulse of ichor within you, the rigidity of your carapace...<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Command Undead</span></span></span></strong>.<br /><br />You experience a moment of vertigo, before gaining a sort of double-vision. You can still quite clearly see the room about you, the pouch before you, but you are also conscious of another view- the inside of the pouch, illuminated by a purple glow. <em><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Be still</span></em>, and the crayfish responds, ceasing its fruitless endeavor. Calmly, you empty the crayfish onto the ground, and it remains docile. From the crayfish&#039;s eyes, you seem enormous, the underside of your bed a dark cavern, the ceiling impossibly high. You do not feel as though you have as much a sense of the crayfish&#039;s body as in your dream, but you do have a general idea about the body&#039;s state of being.<br /><br />With a bit of experimentation, you get the crayfish to tour your room, responding exactly to your mental commands. You discover the zombie isn&#039;t very good at climbing (as might be expected) and that it can take simple directions. You make a list of ten movements for it to execute, relay it to the zombie with the injunction to wait on a command from you, and then watch gleefully as it flawlessly dances your little routine. However, another experiment where you attempt to make the creature alter its path based on external stimuli (hitting it with a rolled-up sock, in this instance) seems to have no effect- perhaps your experiment is flawed, or perhaps zombies simply do not do well with conditional instructions.<br /><br />With one final thought, you order the zombie to walk in circles, then break off the mental contact. The zombie obediently continues to circle on your floor- placing a shoe in its path causes it to move the center of its circle a bit to the left before continuing with its task.<br /><br />Thoughtfully, you crush the zombie beneath your heel, observing as the phosphorescent fire dies in the creatures eyes. At least you&#039;ve managed some control over your creations- privately, you&#039;d begun to fear your creations would control <em>you</em>.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Grek</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">On a somewhat related note, it would do us good to quell the dark thoughts we&#039;ve been having. We&#039;re not so different from other elfs and we&#039;re certainly not evil. Admittedly, what we&#039;re doing is illegal, but it&#039;s <strong>not</strong> evil. The things we&#039;ve revived haven&#039;t harmed anyone, nor have they shown any hint of aggression. Indeed, what we do now seems closer to the Life magics of old, regenerating missing parts of the body, reversing decay and ressurecting the dead. We may be a Necromancer, but before that, we&#039;re an Elf. Not a freak, not an abomination, just an elf with an unusual power.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As you settle down to a <abbr title="Oatmeal with some celebratory Sun Berries mixed in">wholesome breakfast</abbr>, you feel decidedly upbeat about your success, shaking off the melancholy of the day before. So what, if you&#039;re a little different? Most elves are impulsive to a fault, but the Rangers are quite disciplined. Most elves care only for the present, but the Sages gain wisdom and perspective from study of the past. Most elves have mercurial moods, but the Mages need self-control and calm to work their spells. Their differences are their strength, and perhaps it is so with you as well!<br /><br />Buoyed by that happy thought, you are startled by a knock on the door. Apprehensively, you rise to answer it, thinking perhaps someone had come to ask about a strange purple glow in your window this morning. When you open the door, however, you see before you a soggy fisherelf, holding an empty net that will be doubtlessly bulging when he returns home. With a sardonic flourish, he produces a letter- a reply from Elana Foundwasps! <br /><br />Thanking him profusely, you offer him a warm meal and a fireside seat, but he begs your leave and heads upstream. Closing the door, you retreat to your room, opening the letter. Hello-how-are-you-I-am-fine, cordial phrases with little added emotion. Her quill positively glows with enthusiasm for her training, however- she is nearing the end of her novitiate, and is preparing to choose a discipline within the Life Magics for further study. You detect a wistful note as she mentions how little opportunity she has had to socialize- in part due to time constraints on her part, in part due to lack of a close peer group among the Mages. She makes no mention of your history- perhaps a desire to start fresh? If nothing else, she certainly sounds happy enough to have someone to chat with, as evidenced by her prompt reply. Maybe starting fresh is a good thing- this is the start of a new You, after all, and maybe new You won&#039;t make the mistakes old You did.<br /><br />By your reckoning, it is midmorning- should you reply immediately to Elana? What should you say? And what will you do with the remainder of your day- the rain doesn&#039;t look like it is letting up any time soon, so perhaps indoor activities are in order. Then again, few elves will be out and about the forest today- this could be an excellent opportunity to scout out a new place to practice your arts. What to do, what to do...<br /><br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">Vitality- 10/10<br />Mana- 7/10<br />XP= 4/10<br />Inventory- Eight Copper Pieces, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Conceals your nakedness most admirably">Elven Tunic</abbr></span>, Belt Knife, Pouch(5 dead crayfish)<br />Status- Nauseous<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - you can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Necromancy</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Raise Zombie</strong></span></span></span>- ?

Fetching your cloak, you head out to the Temple, snatches of song drifting out of merrily wet windows as you pass. When you arrive, you hasten inside, out of the rain. Quietly passing through private rooms where elves sit in meditation and musty storerooms, you return to Pevo Zephyrtempest&#039;s study. The aging elf sits at his desk, sheaves of paper before him, and smiles up at you as you enter.<br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Well hello there, Nym. Nasty day out, isn&#039;t it?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Indeed it is, Pevo. I must admit, the foul weather inspires foul thoughts, and I&#039;ve been thinking on what you said yesterday.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Oh? And what did I say yesterday?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">You touched on the Sacred Groves, home of Elvenkind. How were they destroyed?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">The Sacred Groves were brimming with Life, more than anywhere on Urak, cultivated and enhanced by the Life Mages. Balkoth and his Necromancers attacked to steal that Vitality, to fuel his armies. When resistance was eliminated, he scoured the earth, drawing every last drop of Life from the very soil itself. Nothing can grow in dead soil, you know.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">But wouldn&#039;t the life return eventually?</span> <br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Mayhap, but it is difficult to adequately describe the devastation Balkoth wrought. He burned every tree, sucked the vitality of the soil, killed and reanimated the creatures for his own fell purposes, and he did this over an <em>enormous </em>area. And I have reason to believe he did something to prevent regrowth there.</span> <br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Why do you say that?</span> <br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Because I&#039;ve been there, dear girl. All sand and rock it is, out in the wilderness far from human habitation. Nearby villages say it is bad luck, or cursed, and it may well be so. I spent days searching, but was unable to find the center of the Groves before I was attacked by a great skeletal monstrosity. Everything we know about Necromancy says that the creature couldn&#039;t possibly date to the Golgothan War- undead simply do not last that long without being cared for.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Wouldn&#039;t someone have seen what was done there? Some survivor, or spy?</span> <br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">There were no Elven survivors. Every Elf who stood to defend their homes instead of fleeing perished- we do not even know how effective their resistance was. Our ancestors spent the next year of the war seeking sanctuary in Thrimesdur, until we were ushered to Yicelafo. The next few years we heard no word from outside the Vale, as we focused on building a new home and hiding from outsiders, for it seemed to our ancestors that Balkoth must prevail, and pursue us sooner or later. We didn&#039;t even hear that the Dwarves had switched sides until years after the fact- the only Elf present at the Last Battle died on the battlefield.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">There was an Elf in the Last Battle?</span> <br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Yes, and a few in other major theaters of the war as well. Many who were adults when they fled the Sacred Grove couldn&#039;t bear to stand by, after learning how complete Balkoth&#039;s devastation had been. After settling the new generation into their new home, they took up arms and rejoined the fight. They were few, and their impact was small, but they were there.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Other theaters? I thought all the fighting occurred in Thrimesdur.</span> <br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Oh my stars, no- although that was where the Last Battle took place, Balkoth and his generals were active across much of Urak. The Black Fleet nearly flanked Thrimesdur by sea, but were ultimately repulsed by the navies of the Jeweled Coast. Balkoth could have swarmed Thrimesdur under an army of zombies six feet deep had he not also needed to defend his rear against the Dwarves. And when the Horse-Lords joined the fray, Balkoth had to divert resources and allies to fighting them at home so they could not deploy on the plains of Thrimesdur in force.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I had no idea the Golgothan war was such an... inclusive affair.</span> <br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Indeed- so far as we know it was the greatest war in the history of Urak. Its study is something of a hobby of mine, which is why I went out in the world so long ago.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Perhaps one day I&#039;ll make such an odyssey myself; See the sights, learn the history. </span> <br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Perhaps you should- there is much that cannot be learned or experienced within the Vale. My time Outside was perhaps the most dangerous, and at times the least pleasant, but it was certainly the most rewarding. Ah, but I have a class of youngsters to teach- please excuse me.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Thank you for your time, Pevo Zephyrtempest.</span> <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2790573#msg2790573">Quote from: Grek on Sun 27-11-2011, 10:40:59</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Anything that reveals us as a necromancer at this point is a luridly bad idea. There is absolutely no way that it would be a good idea, so we&#039;re not going to do that. No raising an undead army, no telling the village elders and, this is an important one, <strong>no more necromancy in town.</strong><br /><br />Instead, we&#039;re going out into the woods and doing some basic tests. Admittedly, most of these are unlikely to work, and they&#039;re not listed in any specific order, but they&#039;re things we&#039;d kick ourselves for not trying sooner if they do turn out to work:<br />-Try that thing woose1 suggested. I kinda doubt that necromancy works like that, but if we find out later that it does, we&#039;ll kick ourselves for not having tried it sooner.<br />-So far, everything we&#039;ve reanimated has had purple fire start glowing in its eyes. What happens if we revive something without eyes, like an earthworm?<br />-Attempt to revive a previously destroyed zombie. While I have the sneaking suspicion that any damage sufficent to destroy a zombie will also prove sufficent to prevent it from being revived once more, it&#039;s another one of those things we&#039;d kick ourselves for not trying sooner if it works.<br />-Try reviving a dead plant. Preferably one that&#039;s largely intact but pretty obviously dead, like a weed you dug up out of the garden and left out to dry for a day or two.<br /><br />Further, I have a short list of longer-term experiments that we should keep in mind if we can&#039;t think of anything else worth trying. Again, not in any specific order.<br />-This one&#039;s a bit morbid, but bear with me. Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-If you ever have enough spare mana, see if you can control multiple dead crayfish at once, and if there&#039;s an upper limit on how many perspectives you can hold at once. Stop if you get a headache, feel dizzy or anything else seems strange.<br />-See what the maximum range is for controling one of your zombies, and if it expands with practice. May take more than a day of effort, but it&#039;ll be good exercise.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2790233#msg2790233">Quote from: woose1 on Sun 27-11-2011, 07:24:29</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Also, as an experiment: <strong>attempt to use our life-manipulation abilities to transfer the &#039;life force&#039; we find in the corpses back into us, to fuel raising the dead.

By your best guess, it is a bit after noon- the morning&#039;s incident has reminded you that you need to gain more control of your Necromantic arts, and though you lack a truly safe haven for such experimentation you predict that a secluded glade in the woods will be safe enough, as all the elves who would normally be out and about will be staying safely at home today. To the forest!<br /><br />After an hour or so of walking, you find a place where the trees grow thickly together, providing relief from the wind and the worst of the rain. Settling down on your heels, you drop a crayfish corpse on the wet leaves of the forest floor. You theorize that Necromancy, at its most basic, involves taking latent Vitality from a corpse and rekindling it, bringing the target back to some semblance of life. If true, then you should be able to draw that latent Vitality out of the corpse and into you, instead of leaving it in the body.<br /><br />You focus your will on the crayfish- nothing. You try to empathize with the corpse- nothing. You try to invert the way Mana normally flows out of you, but all you accomplish is giving yourself a slight headache. Perhaps you&#039;re going about this the wrong way, or perhaps your theory is wrong.<br /><br />Next on the agenda- eyeless earthworms! A bit of rooting is sufficient to discover a nice big one writhing in the mud, but much like the ant you are a bit concerned about how to kill it without simply rendering it into goo. After casting about a bit, you find a nice big puddle and proceed to drown the creature in it. It takes a while to drown, but it&#039;s an earthworm- they die hard. Returning to the relative dryness beneath the trees, you focus your will and <abbr title="1 MP"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Raise Zombie</span></span></strong></span></abbr>.<br /><br />The earthworm begins, almost imperceptibly, to glow purple. It also tries to start burrowing, before you snatch it up for closer inspection. The glow appears to be emanating from tiny, nearly invisible bristles. On a hunch, you cast <abbr title="1 MP"><strong>Sense Vitality</strong></abbr>- the zombie barely registers as containing any Vitality, although the trees around you have dozens of VP each. Bringing your will to bear, you try to draw that smidgeon of Vitality out of the worm and into you, forming a connection between you an-<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Steal Vitality</span></span></span></strong><br /><br />A purple spark flies from the worm to you, blinding you with its brilliance before it strikes you in the face! With a startled yelp, you fall backwards, clutching at your head. Tentatively, you probe with your fingers- no damage appears to have been done. You walk over to the puddle- no marks on your face, no blemishes. You examine the worm in your hand, discovering that it is no longer a zombie, although it does not appear to have suffered any physical damage.<br /><br />Calming yourself, you think back to the moment the spark hit you. You think, perhaps, you felt something, but if the worm had held a smidgen then what was stolen was a mere smidgen of a smidgen. You are reasonably sure that, given a target with more Vitality, you would get more noticeable results.<br /><br />You judge that although night is approaching, you have time for one more experiment. Returning to the crayfish, you cast <abbr title="1 MP"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Raise Zombie</span></span></strong></span></abbr>, watching as purple fire erupts from its eyes and it begins to shamble about. You then place your foot on the zombie and begin to slowly press down, listening to the creature&#039;s carapace snap and pop. As soon as the purple fire dies, you quickly remove your foot before lifting the creature for inspection.<br /><br />The crayfish&#039;s body is broken- the shell is shattered in a few places, and most of its limbs are twisted at an unnatural angle, one of its legs gone entirely. Bits of crayfish innards ooze through the cracks in the shell. Gently setting it back on the forest floor, you <abbr title="2 MP"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Raise Zombie</span></span></strong></span></abbr> once more. It takes noticeably more energy, but once again the crayfish rises. You bend down, looking- purple fire blazes from the cracks in the shell, and the broken legs are straight. The missing leg is still gone, however.<br /><br />Out of mana and out of time, you crush the crayfish once more before setting off for home. You arrive in a drizzle sometime after sunset- exhausted by your day&#039;s effort, you decide to skip dinner and go straight to bed. You sleep long and peacefully, with no interruptions. The next morning, the sullen sky promises more rain to come, but right now it is dry.<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">Vitality- 10/10<br />Mana- 10/10<br />XP= 8/10<br />Inventory- Eight Copper Pieces, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Conceals your nakedness most admirably">Elven Tunic</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Belt Knife, Pouch(4 dead crayfish)<br />Status- Content<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - you can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Necromancy</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Raise Zombie</strong></span></span></span>- ?

Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-If you ever have enough spare mana, see if you can control multiple dead crayfish at once, and if there&#039;s an upper limit on how many perspectives you can hold at once. Stop if you get a headache, feel dizzy or anything else seems strange.<br />-See what the maximum range is for controling one of your zombies, and if it expands with practice. May take more than a day of effort, but it&#039;ll be good exercise.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour. <br /></div></div></div>

Since bare sustenance isn&#039;t a big concern, Elves feel free to pursue whatever interests them, and only work for luxury items or as a favor to friends. <br /><br />You, specifically, used to pull your weight by fishing to replace what you took from your parents house and doing odd jobs around town to raise the cash to buy creature comforts, like pants. Since fishing is a largely solitary endeavor (for you, anyway) most people probably don&#039;t realize your routine is that much different. Those who do probably assume you&#039;ve found another fishing hole, though they may comment on it if they don&#039;t see you for long enough.<br /><br />Short version, I&#039;ll give you warning if you&#039;re being too much of an Elven slacker <img src="./Necromancer/7.gif" alt="&#58;P" title="Tongue" class="smiley" /></div>

I don&#039;t know of any Elf who can make those.</span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">It isn&#039;t that difficult- anyone can learn the necessary spell. Mages tend to make them for themselves, though, since demand is low and their greater Mana reserves allow them to make more potent potables. The tricky part is getting the Crystal for the task.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Crystal?</span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">You know, magical crystal. It is the only substance we know of that can reliably store and release Mana, and is an extremely versatile material with applications in almost all alchemical processes as well as many other branches of spellcraft. We don&#039;t have a natural supply of it, instead importing it from Thrimesdur and the Jeweled Coast.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">So Mana Potions make you more powerful, then.</span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">Well, yes and no. Mana Potions replenish your Mana reserves, they don&#039;t expand them. A Mana Potion wouldn&#039;t do a random peasant any good.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">What if you had a problem that you didn&#039;t have the man reserve to face?</span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">A problem I don&#039;t have the power to resolve, <em>indeed</em>. In your hypothetical situation, I suppose I would call on my fellow Mages to help me solve it- very few things on Urak can face our unified might.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">What if you couldn&#039;t get help from your colleagues? What if you had to do it yourself, for some reason?</span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What if, what if!&quot; IF I faced a problem I couldn&#039;t handle alone, and IF I couldn&#039;t call in outside help, then my only recourse would be to somehow obtain an Artifact of Power that could help.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">An Artifact of Power?</span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">Yes. Before the Golgothan War, it is said the great Magic-Users of Urak knew the making of Artifacts, items that could enhance the abilities of their wielder. Swords that flamed, shields that healed, boots that let the wearer fly, that sort of thing. Some of them help enhance the magical power of Mages, either through increasing their Mana reserve or allowing them to cast spells normally beyond their ability. In your extremely unlikely situation, I might be able to gain permission to use of one of the few such items our people possess- I&#039;d have to talk to the Druid though, so I doubt that would help much.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I see. Well, I won&#039;t hold you here any longer- good luck with your tree!</span><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2796929#msg2796929">Quote from: lurtze1 on Tue 29-11-2011, 20:37:31</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2796739#msg2796739">Quote from: kopout on Tue 29-11-2011, 19:03:18</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Some proposed changes to planned experiments<br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Planned Experiments</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">-Zombie plants!

Last time, you went South, so this time you decide to go North. This path takes you deeper into the forest, away from the Great River and Elven habitation.<br /><br />After an hour or so of walking, you enter the oldest parts of the Vale. The trees here are enormous, with thick, gnarled roots clawing out of the ground. The branches overhead choke out the light of day, starving the vegetation beneath the canopy. You walk through a forlorn, emerald light, across a carpet of soggy leaves and broken twigs. It is very quiet here, very serene. Feeling you have come a safe distance from Elven habitation, you step off the game trail, searching among the roots and tree trunks for a suitable place to call your own.<br /><br />After perhaps another hour or so of searching, you find it! In the center of a dense stand of trees, you find a great old oak, struck by lightning years past. The dead tree is partially fallen, held up by the branches of its neighbors- the trunk is shattered, and large branches yet lie scattered about. There is a sheltered space between the angled trunk and the ground, partially screened from the outside world by branches torn down in the old tree&#039;s falling.<br /><br />Picking your way inside, you grin in satisfaction. A large pile of leaves and twigs shows where animals sheltered in days gone past, but it is clear the hollow is unoccupied now. The roots of an adjacent tree provide comfortable seating, and the soft earth beneath them would be an excellent place to store food, equipment, and any experiments you choose.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2795273#msg2795273">Quote from: woose1 on Tue 29-11-2011, 04:29:42</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Fuck.

Chances are, the energy stored in a large organism like a tree can cause a decently-sized explosion.<br /><br />Then I guess we can try raising it. I don&#039;t think a zombie tree would be very interesting though. We&#039;d better also make sure to do it somewhere WAAAYY out of range of the elf village. We don&#039;t want no goddamn tree-hugging hippies finding out we&#039;re preforming horrible unnatural experiments on the local flora.<br /><br />Also, based on what the old guy said, we can apparently raise just skeletons, without any flesh on them. It probably costs a lot more than raising a fleshy minion, but they last much longer. (This is just pure speculation.)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />After tidying up your new getaway, you decide to celebrate with some experimentation!<br /><br />First up, you decide to give your vitality stealing powers a swing. After a moment&#039;s consideration, you decide against zapping any of the trees holding up your abode, instead moving to the other end of your hollow to zap one of the trees there. Placing your hand on the tree trunk, you <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Steal Vitality</span></strong></span></span>.<br /><br />You feel your magical energy pierce the tree, and siphon some of its Vitality. You can almost hear the tree groan as your magic attacks its life-force directly, but soon your eyes detect a glowing purple ball of energy emerge from the bark, floating before you. It begins to float towards you as though drawn by a swift current, but focusing your will you hold the Vitality away from you- you don&#039;t need it yourself, after all. Instead, you decide to try and use this energy to destroy something! You set your sights on a nearby rock, forced mostly out of the ground by growing roots and about as large as your head. You throw the Vitality at it, forcing the energy into it! You feel great resistance, but your will prevails, and-<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Animate Object</span></strong></span></span><br /><br />You blink in disbelief as the rock suddenly draws the Vitality into itself! You take a step forward, but are suddenly swept by a feeling of intense vertigo! The vertigo passes, but you feel something swell within yourself, as if long-tensed muscles had finally been allowed to relax, stretching outward. You happily note your Mana pool seems larger- your practice is paying off!<br /><br />Cautiously, you approach the rock- it looks rather the same as it did before. Frowning, you begin to cast Sense Vitality, but stop- you can already see the Vitality of the rock! It registers as having 2- presumably what you stole from the tree. You glance at the tree- you can&#039;t tell how much Vitality <em>it</em> has, though you know the Sense Vitality spell would tell you. You&#039;d heard that practiced Mages could sense Vitality even without the aid of a spell, but you&#039;d always dismissed that as a rumor. Perhaps skill in the magical arts brings more than an increased Mana Pool, you muse.<br /><br />You bend closer- to your eye, the rock appears to have a fine network of purple lines across it. You sense, rather than see, an undirected ball of Vitality within. The rock doesn&#039;t appear to be doing anything.<br /><br />Sighing, you consider your situation. Animating that rock took a lot of Mana- it is only midafternoon, but you don&#039;t have that much Mana left. Should you continue with one of your less Mana-intensive experiments, or do you have an idea for an experiment you could do related to your new-found abilities? And what will you do with the Rock, when you finish for today? You don&#039;t know if you can easily destroy it, and although you can probably suck the Vitality out of it with a spell that would leave nothing for experimentation. Then again, it&#039;s a rock- it doesn&#039;t appear to be able to move, and it isn&#039;t obviously <del>alive</del> <del>undead</del> animate.

First, you cast <strong>Sense Vitality</strong>, and gain awareness of the Vitality around you. Interestingly enough, you note that while Sense Vitality informs you that Rocky has 2 Vitality, that is all it informs you of. You don&#039;t see the web of purple energy you can detect with your Necromantic Sight, nor do you have the sense the Vitality is concentrated anywhere in particular.<br /><br />You first shield the rock in your cloak. You note that although Sense Vitality only works on line-of-sight (thus failing with this rudimentary precaution) your Necromantic Sight can still sense Rocky- although you can&#039;t see any of the details, you still know there&#039;s a 2 Vitality strong something or other beneath the cloak.<br /><br />Rocky is too large to fit in your pouch, so you walk to the other side of a living tree and take a look. Sense Vitality, as expected, only registers the presence of the Tree&#039;s Vitality. Your Necromantic Sight, while unable to detect the tree&#039;s Vitality, is able to sense the Vitality of Rocky, but fainter than before. Backing up, you lose awareness of Rocky when you are about twenty feet away. Circling so you have line of sight to the cloaked rock, you still do not have awareness of it. When you approach again, you gain a stronger and stronger sense of it.<br /><br />Drawing your belt knife, you begin digging into the soft, rain-soaked earth. After some time and effort, you have a nice little hole dug- rolling Rocky in, you quickly bury him. Your Sense Vitality spell has by now worn off, but you&#039;re certain that if it couldn&#039;t work through your cloak it won&#039;t work through the dirt. Your Necromantic senses seem muffled somewhat by the layer of dirt- you can still sense it, but you need to be fairly close- a dozen feet at the most. It is fairly obvious that something is buried here, however- the dirt is freshly turned, the leaves scattered, bits of sod strewn about. Then again, part of the reason you&#039;re out here is because no Elf is likely to stumble upon your hideaway, and even if they did, they aren&#039;t terribly likely to try and detect Vitality in a rock they find in a hole in the ground.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2798721#msg2798721">Quote from: EveryZig on Wed 30-11-2011, 09:29:23</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We should find a living insect then attempt to move the vitality from the rock to the insect, crushing the insect after we are done.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2799915#msg2799915">Quote from: kopout on Thu 01-12-2011, 00:45:59</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Problem. The rock is not full of mana it is ful of vitality. I like the idea of having life stored in things as a way to have quick and dirty healing, <strong>see if it is easyer to drain life from animate objects than from living things</strong> try this after we have tried to take over the rock though, if it looks like it will cost more then 2 to do we should stop part way through. that is another idea, <strong>see what hapenes when you stop a spell part way through</strong> do you expend some of the mana cost all of it or none of it. I doubt it will cost less to steel from an animate object though as it cost 3&nbsp; to steal from the zombie as well as the tree.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Although you think it would be safe enough to leave Rocky unattended, you decide to perform a different experiment instead. Unearthing the Rock (much easier now that you&#039;ve loosened the earth,) you snag a beetle you find hiding in the dirt. Bringing your will to bear, you <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Steal Vitality</span></strong></span></span> from Rocky. To your chagrin, you completely snuff Rocky&#039;s Vitality while only withdrawing some small fraction of it- a third of what it had, maybe half a Vitality point altogether. Nothing you can make use of, but then, this beetle is much smaller than you. <br /><br />You redirect the Vitality flowing from Rocky to the beetle instead of you. To your eye, the Vitality appears to strike the beetle and bounce, dissipating. You ponder what this means, as you crush the beetle for safety. Maybe you can&#039;t push Vitality into living things, only dead things. Or maybe it would have worked if the beetle was injured first- perhaps this is just an indication you can&#039;t &quot;supercharge&quot; Vitality with this spell. Or maybe you just didn&#039;t have enough Vitality in your grasp to do anything with. Maybe it&#039;s something else entirely...<br /><br />Well, you are out of Mana, and judging by the bit of sky you can see through the hole in the canopy it is nearing dusk. Noticing your crayfish have definitely started to turn, you leave your pouch hanging from the dead tree, hopefully safe from scavengers- you could use a chest to store things in, you reflect. Mentally marking your path, you return home, arriving a couple hours later. Eating your usual dinner of fish and wine, you enjoy an extremely restful night&#039;s sleep.<br /><br />After finishing your breakfast, you arise at a knock on the door- it is the same fisherman as before, bearing another letter from Elana Foundwasps! Eagerly, you accept the letter and settle down at the table to read it.<br /><br />After going through the pleasantries, the letter assumes a scholarly, lecturing tone. You grin- it&#039;s from Elana, all right. Life Magic, she writes, is fundamentally the art of encouraging the growth of Vitality. The practitioners of Life Magic have developed different techniques, depending on the effect the Mage wishes to achieve. <br /><br />Growth is the most basic of the disciplines, and involves encouraging the development of living things. Mages who specialize in the discipline spend much time learning about the anatomies of many diverse creatures and plants- living things are complex beings, and to maximize potential requires a deep understanding of the finer mechanisms of Life itself.<br /><br />Healing is another widely practiced discipline, and focuses on strengthening the life in a particular part of the body to facilitate rapid recuperation. Mages specializing in the discipline know much about the healing process as a whole, and can also help living things fight off disease.<br /><br />The third, smallest discipline within Life magic is Imbalance, and is the use of Life magic as a weapon. Mages who specialize in the discipline can cause normally innocuous diseases to become life threatening illness, and can interfere with the biological mechanism of life by accelerating the growth of one area of the body without increasing the capacity of the body to handle the imbalance.<br /><br />There is a certain amount of overlap, and since Elves are immortal they have the time to master all three disciplines, which puts&nbsp; less emphasis on specializing on one to the exclusion of the others. Elana is new at the art, however, so her initial discipline will inform her abilities for years to come. She says she is undecided between the Growth and Healing disciplines- she considers the use of Life Magic to destroy to be a perversion of her gift, as do most Mages. In fact, the few living Elves who are considered masters of that discipline are all old enough to have been children or novices during the Flight.<br /><br /><br />You set down the letter, reflecting on your own school of Magic. If Life is, fundamentally, the growth and increasing of Vitality, then what is Necromancy, exactly? You know it isn&#039;t just corpse related, and apparently it has applications on things that were never alive in the first place. It is certainly something to ponder.<br /><br />It is still early morning, and the sun is shining. Should you reply to Elana now, or later, and what should you say? Do you have any other tasks you&#039;d like to accomplish in town, or should you get straight to the experimentation?<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">Vitality- 10/10<br />Mana- 12/12<br />XP= 10/20<br />Inventory- Eight Copper Pieces, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Conceals your nakedness most admirably">Elven Tunic</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Belt Knife<br />Abilities- See Necromancy(Passive)<br />Status- Content<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - you can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Necromancy</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Raise Zombie</strong></span></span></span>- ?

Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-If you ever have enough spare mana, see if you can control multiple dead crayfish at once, and if there&#039;s an upper limit on how many perspectives you can hold at once. Stop if you get a headache, feel dizzy or anything else seems strange.<br />-See what the maximum range is for controling one of your zombies, and if it expands with practice. May take more than a day of effort, but it&#039;ll be good exercise.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-Make a zombie insect that will stand still, then see if we can take its vitality when it is behind a rock (out of our line of sight).<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br /></div></div></div>

You need to get more serious about leaving for Thrimesdur, starting now!<br /><br />You pen a quick letter to Elana Foundwasps, expressing some interest in her activities and the choice she faces before mentioning how your recent studies have given you a keen interest in life outside the Vale. You then write two more letters- one to your Mother, and one to your Father, informing them of your decision. They deserve to know.<br /><br />These letters are important enough- and their recipients distant enough- that you feel the need to insure their speedy delivery. You find a young elf boy, and after a bit of haggling he agrees to carry your letter- in exchange for <abbr title="Smoked salmon isn&#039;t good enough for him, oh no- he wants cheese and candied nuts!">three days&#039; rations</abbr> and TWO copper pieces, the greedy bastard! Sourly, you watch him dart off- at least he&#039;ll deliver the letters straightaway. He&#039;d better, for that price!<br /><br />Heading to the Temple, you find Pevo singing a Teaching Song to a group of small children. You smile- it&#039;s one of your favorites, about the First Great Caravan that came to Yicelafo after the Golgothan War, bearing news about Balkoth&#039;s fall and bringing many fine crafts and supplies never before seen in the Young Vale. There is a sense of wonder in the tale, of a renewal in interest in the places beyond the borders of the Vale, coupled with an assuaging of fear. As Pevo finishes, sending the children off to lunch, you sit down with him.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Your song echoes my thoughts, Pevo Zephyrtempest- I&#039;ve a yearning to see the places beyond the Vale, to feel the wind in my hair.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Oh, do you now? You do- I recognize that glint in the eye. I won&#039;t try to stop you- in fact, I&#039;ll speak to the Elders on your behalf.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">You will?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">I will. I&#039;ll ask you a question- can you tell me the last time somebody left the Vale?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">No. When was the last time somebody left the Vale?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Two hundred and eighteen years ago. And that was just an expedition to catch a thief in the Thrimesdur Caravan- they never left the Walled Jungle. The last time an Elf walked in human lands was Two hundred sixty three years ago, when an adventurous young Ranger decided to leave with the Caravan and travel the Jeweled Coast- he fell in love with the Sea, and only visits infrequently now. I don&#039;t believe he&#039;s returned to Yicelafo since before you were born, though he&#039;s sent letters.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Two and a half centuries? That&#039;s a pretty long time.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">And it is even longer by human standards- the grandfathers in Thrimesdur have maybe heard stories about <em>their </em>grandfathers&#039; grandfathers encounters with Elvenkind. <em>Maybe</em>- more likely, most humans have forgotten we exist. I fear we are becoming too insulated, too cut off from the rest of the world. No, I won&#039;t oppose your journey- I&#039;ll do whatever I can to aid you.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">It is good to have your support, Pevo. Do you have any advice on what to bring, or where to go?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Go wherever your feet take you, though it will be easier to convince the Elders to let you go to Thrimesdur- they are more comfortable with them than other humans. There is all kinds of equipment you could take with you- food, rope, bedroll, candles and crowbars, fishhooks and flasks, paper, parchment, pouches! I doubt you can afford a pack animal, so you&#039;ll have to make do- take what you can carry, and remember you can always buy what you need in most towns. Oh, I know! Come with me.</span><br /><br />Pevo clambers to his feet, then leads you to his study. Rooting around his desk, he eventually comes up with a scrap of paper, then presents it to you proudly.<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Yicelafo Map</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><a href="http://img.ie/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/6.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a></div></div><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">What is this thing?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">A map of Yicelafo, of my own creation!</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">It is?

And the green lines?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">That would be the expanses of the Walled Jungle. And before you ask, those yellow dots are Elven hamlets, with Yicelafo proper being the one with the star, and the Black circle to the East is Larothor, &quot;Squeezedlips.&quot; It is a moderately prosperous town of the Empire, and is where the caravans ferry across the Great River. It would be a good place to start your journey- from there, you can take the road or a boat South to visit the great cities, and if you reach the coast you&#039;ll be able to find a ship going just about anywhere.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Thank you- this is very useful! What if, say, I wanted to visit the Grove Wasteland?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Then you&#039;d be a fool, but you&#039;d be a fool that should take the road East out of Larothor. You&#039;d want to travel to the Capitol of the Empire, where you&#039;d choose to either head north across the wilderness or continue east until you hit the river- you should be able to get better maps there, anyway, to base your final decision on.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I suppose I&#039;m a fool then- I&#039;d like to visit the home of our ancestors.

With the day half gone, you elect to spend the latter half of this day in experimentation at the Tree.<br /><br />You first decide to try converting Vitality into Mana- it certainly seems like a Necromantic sort of thing to do, and didn&#039;t you hear a story about Necromancers killing people for power?<br /><br />You <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Steal Vitality</span></strong></span></span> from a nearby tree, and easily handle the ball of Vitality that emerges. You think of the way Mana feels when it flows out of you when spellcasting, then imagine that flow reversed. Nothing. You try to focus on the Vitality, thinking to break it down somehow, but it seems as homogeneous as water. You try to pull it into you while directing it towards your Mana pool, but the Vitality just hits you and dissipates without noticeable effect.<br /><br />Frustrated, You walk back to the tree and try to feel the Vitality within- maybe you can extract the Vitality as Mana directly. You can&#039;t detect the Vitality, so you <strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- you can feel the Vitality, but you just sense its presence, not its form or its flow. You try to reach in and take it with your thoughts, but you realize that you are simply preparing your Vitality stealing spell, not attempting something new. It seems like there should be a way to do this, but you can&#039;t figure it out.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2808819#msg2808819">Quote from: Lord Allagon on Sun 04-12-2011, 18:58:41</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2808157#msg2808157">Quote from: Gamerlord on Sun 04-12-2011, 09:04:36</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">This looks awesome!<br /><br /><strong>We should fashion or buy a doll that can move it&#039;s limbs (has joints) and try to animate it.</strong><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> I support this.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2808993#msg2808993">Quote from: EveryZig on Sun 04-12-2011, 20:53:39</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">With the doll experiment, we can save ourselves some time and effort by using a piece of rope. That should be flexible enough while still being readily available. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You get a short length of Rope Reed Fiber rope, and settle down to weave it into a doll. The task is surprisingly more difficult than it looked when your mother did it for you as a child, but after some trial and error you hold a figure with a large, looped head, two long looped legs and short, uneven arms formed from the end pieces. Gingerly, you rest it on Rocky and attempt to <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Animate Object</span></strong></span></span>- nothing.<br /><br />Puzzled, you try again, but the Mana fails to release properly. After a bit of thought, you remember that you were already manipulating Vitality the last time you cast this spell. Moving to a tree you haven&#039;t sapped yet, you <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Steal Vitality</span></strong></span></span>, extracting a ball of 2 Vitality from the living wood. As the ball of Vitality floats toward you, you gently redirect it to the Rope Doll, murmuring <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Animate Object</span></strong></span></span>.<br /><br />Success- of a sort. The Vitality bleeds into the Doll, and your Necromantic Sight registers the Doll as possessing 2 Vitality... but the Doll just lies there. To your eye, the fibers of the rope bristle with purple fire, but it seems undirected. You poke at the Doll, but it remains limp and unresponsive. You attempt to <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Command Undead</span></strong></span></span>, but the spell fails to resolve- you realize you don&#039;t know what it&#039;s like being a Rope Doll, and the spell requires a certain amount of empathy.<br /><br />You focus your mind on the Doll, trying to <em>be </em>the rope. It needs eyes, you think- if it had eyes, it could see. You try to imagine seeing through the eyes of the Doll, looking up at the canopy of the forest, and-<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 16pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Alter Golem</span></strong></span></span><br /><br />You jump back, startled, as phosphorescent purple fire leaps to life! The head loop seems to gather the purple fire from throughout its body, concentrating it in the center of the loop. The head loop is alive with purple fire, but within the swirling energy is two bright points of purple flame- eyes.<br /><br />You poke the Doll again, but still elicit no response. You yearn to experiment further, but you are out of mana for the day. You bury the Doll, and leave to do some fishing before sunset.<br /><br /><br /><br />The next day is bright and sunny as you return to your experimentation. Digging up the Doll, it appears to have suffered no harm for its night in the dirt. You <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Command Undead</span></strong></span></span>, and this time your consciousness readily merges with the Doll. You can feel the dirt ingrained in the rope fiber- you try to lift your head, but fail. In fact, although you can look about freely with your eyes (even going so far as to peer out the back of your head at the stone you lay on,) you lack the strength to move the rest of your body. Curious- why is that?<br /><br />Lacking ideas for further study regarding the Doll, you turn to accomplish one of your previous experiments- the zombification of a plant! You realize you probably should have uprooted a shrub yesterday in preparation for this task, since plants take a while to die... but then you remember you&#039;re sitting inside of a big ol&#039; dead tree!<br /><br />Moving outside, you focus on the tree and <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Raise Zombie</strong></span></span></span>- and stagger back, in pain and shock! Clutching a nearby tree to hold yourself up, you take stock- raising the tree not only drained your <abbr title="10 at time of casting"><em>entire mana pool</em></abbr>, but it appears to have caused you harm as well! Drawing a shuddering breath, you examine the oak- it&#039;s undead alright. The entire trunk is wreathed in dancing purple fire. Examining the hollow, you notice that where there used to be a deep gouge in the core of the tree there is now a purple cylinder bridging the gap. Purple fire seems to flow up and down the trunk within that cylinder.<br /><br />Standing back, you gaze on the tree in dismay. Even now, in the middle of the day, you can see the purple glow faintly reflected by the surrounding trees. At night, this place will blaze like a bonfire. But what can you do about it?

Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-If you ever have enough spare mana, see if you can control multiple dead crayfish at once, and if there&#039;s an upper limit on how many perspectives you can hold at once. Stop if you get a headache, feel dizzy or anything else seems strange.<br />-See what the maximum range is for controling one of your zombies, and if it expands with practice. May take more than a day of effort, but it&#039;ll be good exercise.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments.

No dead branches we could have dislodged!?<br /><br />What fools we are!<br /><br />But the question remains - can anyone other than ourselves even SEE the purple fire? When the skeleton was mentioned, nothing was mentioned about a purple flame - in fact, can you recall any mention of a purple flame, or is this simple the swirls of necromantic magic?<br /><br />First, determine if we need to hide it at all - Walk a distance away, and see if the light grows dimmer - if it grows dimmer more quickly than the visibility of the tree, it is likely a byproduct of our magic vision rather than our true vision. We should be okay, in that case.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2819894#msg2819894">Quote from: Grek on Fri 09-12-2011, 08:58:17</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Face it: we&#039;re panicking. Stop. Breathe. Doesn&#039;t that feel better? There&#039;s still six hours till dusk. Eight until it&#039;s properly dark. GlyphGryph has the right idea here. <strong>Do the test that GlyphGryph suggested.</strong> Rocky (who had 2 vitality) was invisible to Sense Vitality at a distance of 20 feet. If the range is linear with vitality, then the tree should become invisible at a range of 50 feet. If it&#039;s exponential (5 feet per point of vitality squared), then the necromantic aura will become invisible past 125 feet.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ok, ok, this isn&#039;t that bad- it isn&#039;t good, but it&#039;s not bad. After all, wasn&#039;t the whole point of doing this off in the deep woods so that random elves won&#039;t see you? First things first- let&#039;s see exactly how visible this mess is.<br /><br />You first consider the possibility that the visible evidence is merely a product of your Necromantic Sight, an ability only you possess. This tree may well be invisible to the casual observer! With some chagrin, however, you remember that the trout had purple flames sprout from its eyes, and the ant had purple flame instead of a head- this was when you first discovered your power, and before you developed your Necromantic Sight. You also recall how your undead crayfish mishap was able to feebly illuminate your room- not a good sign.<br /><br />Of course, theory is all well and good, but some solid experimental data is in order. Staying within the confines of your little grove, you stand at various distances to the tree- there is no real change in its appearance, and only slight variation in your Necromantic Sight. You begin backing through the trees, attempting to keep the tree in sight- although the tree&#039;s fire appears no dimmer, you do gradually lose your sense of the tree, finally petering out around 125ft from the tree. Doing some quick mental arithmetic (a skill you&#039;ve had little reason to exercise before now,) you deduce that your Necromantic Sight must have a range relating exponentially to the Vitality of the Necromantic Energy being sensed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the tree is still quite visible at this range, although the trees make direct line of sight difficult. Circling around, you find that about 150-200 feet from the tree you cannot directly see it- however, you can still see the purple light reflected off the surrounding trees, even in the middle of the day. You suspect it will be much more visible at night, although it will also be less likely that an Elf will be in the area.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2821379#msg2821379">Quote from: Rockowl on Sat 10-12-2011, 01:31:42</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I agree with Sense Vitality.

If they don&#039;t press further (or don&#039;t comment on it in the first place), all is good. If they do press further, explain that we were worried that animals in Thrimesdur might be more aggressive and harder to calm. This, of course, is a cover story for our research, but it does have a grain of truth to it. We will want to make use of the mana potion if there&#039;s an emergency we don&#039;t have enough mana to deal with, and it is possible that animals in Thrimesdur aren&#039;t as friendly to the elves as the ones from home.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Although you briefly entertain the notion of getting an axe or starting forest fires to deal with your problem, you decide that the most expedient way to take care of the tree would be to use your magic. Although you are out of Mana, you were planning to weasel a Potion out of somebody anyway- may as well push that task to the top of your priority list! It&#039;s about an hour&#039;s walk back to the village- you can be back in two, three hours tops.<br /><br />You waste no time, and hustle back to the village. Although you initially plan to jog, or at least hurry, you find yourself short of breath- that casting took more out of you than you thought. Still, you manage to maintain a steady, ground-eating pace back to the village.<br /><br />When you return, slowing to a nonchalant stroll, you ponder which way to go. You had initially planned to buy a Mana Potion from a merchant, but that would involve a trip to a larger village across the river, and would add travel time to your task. In addition, you aren&#039;t sure how much a Mana Potion costs- you don&#039;t exactly have the time to spend an afternoon doing chores in payment. You remember that Pevo had mentioned how most Mages make their own Mana Potions- perhaps you could find Ari Wetdawn and persuade him to part with one. It&#039;s a place to start, anyway.<br /><br />You get to the Temple in no time at all, and spy Pevo ambling inside. Lengthening your stride, you quickly catch up.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Hey, Pevo! Pevo, have you seen Ari about? I need to speak with him.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">He&#039;s off on some task or another, Nym. He should be back sometime tonight.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Oh, burn me. It figures.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Oh? What did you need to discuss with him, that haste is such a concern?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Oh... it&#039;s nothing that can&#039;t wait, I suppose. I&#039;d just thought that a Mana Potion might be useful for my journey to Thrimesdur.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">What do you need a Mana Potion for?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">You know, emergencies.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Oh, because your awesome arcane powers will get you out of any pickle, is that it?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Oh stop- I just thought that it&#039;d be useful in case I encounter a great many vicious animals, or something.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">I can assure you that most of the animals you&#039;ll encounter can be pacified as easily in Thrimesdur as here in the Vale. However, even without exhaustive magic use you&#039;ll be able to find a use for Mana Potions.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I will?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Oh, aye- for barter! Magic use is much less prevalent among the humans, and many of them are untutored by our standards. While almost all elves have some small Mana pool to draw upon, most humans don&#039;t have any at all, and many of those born to magic learn only the bare necessities before returning to service their home village. Why, more than a few times I paid for my lodging by making some weak Mana Potions for those weak wizards.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Really? You know how to make Mana Potions?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">I do. In fact, my errand here today is to drop off a potion I whipped up for Ari- he&#039;s been too busy to tend to it lately, and it isn&#039;t like he needs a particularly powerful potion to supplement his abilities. Tell you what- how about, instead of just giving you this here potion, I show you how to make your own?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">That&#039;d be great! Um... how long does this normally take?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Once you&#039;ve gotten the hang of it, it&#039;ll only take a couple hours, and most of that is just mundane brewery. The tricky part is learning the magecraft involved, since any mistake means you have to start over. I know I spent the better part of a day trying before I got the knack, my first time. What, do you have someplace else to be?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I...</span><br /><br />On the one hand, learning this skill would be an invaluable asset. On the other hand, it sounds like the learning itself could easily suck up the rest of the afternoon and perhaps your evening, all while your Tree blazes merrily away. You could just wheedle that potion out of Pevo now and come back to learn another day... right?

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-If you ever have enough spare mana, see if you can control multiple dead crayfish at once, and if there&#039;s an upper limit on how many perspectives you can hold at once. Stop if you get a headache, feel dizzy or anything else seems strange.<br />-See what the maximum range is for controling one of your zombies, and if it expands with practice. May take more than a day of effort, but it&#039;ll be good exercise.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-Make a zombie insect that will stand still, then see if we can take its vitality when it is behind a rock (out of our line of sight).<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: World Map</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Yicelafo Map</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><a href="http://img.ie/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/6.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a></div></div></div>

I can&#039;t take this!</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Sure you can! You might have scraped together enough coin to get by outside the Vale, but I&#039;d like you to do more than get by. Besides, the Caravan from Thrimesdur will be here soon, and you might spy something you need for your journey.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Wait, really? Don&#039;t you think it&#039;s a bit early in the Spring yet?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Early it may be, but the Caravan is coming, no mistake. You haven&#039;t heard? They crossed the river yesterday, and should be moving through Yicelafo tomorrow. Ahh, my mind is slipping- I won&#039;t be able to teach you tomorrow, I&#039;ll be spending the day at the Caravan Fair.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Oh come on, the Caravan should be here a solid week! Besides, the festivities won&#039;t really kick in for a few days, once all the other elves arrive.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Aye, there&#039;s the rub! I&#039;m not about to let every other elf in the Vale pick over the good stuff before I get there, and I&#039;m certainly not going to be last to hear news of foreign lands!</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Alright, fair enough- you&#039;ve really done more than enough already. Thank you, Pevo.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Not a problem, not a problem- will I see you at the Fair?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Maybe not tomorrow, but we&#039;ll see. Farewell!</span><br /><br />You wave goodbye, weighed down with Pevo&#039;s gifts. You give the Mana Potion a quick examination- the bottle is a dark, translucent blue, and fits comfortably in your closed fist. Unstoppering the bottle, you peer inside, sloshing about a dark liquid. Red, maybe? You catch a faint fruity scent wafting from the bottle- it seems familiar, though you can&#039;t quite place it. Carefully, you stopper the bottle back up and tuck it into your coin pouch.<br /><br />Although visiting Omo Thuderjaw had not been in your plans prior to your conversation with Pevo, it had been something you wanted to do before leaving anyway. Besides, you can hardly <em>not </em>see him after using him as an excuse, and it&#039;s not like this should take long.<br /><br />Without wasting time, You head off to Omo&#039;s house. It isn&#039;t all that far from your own- elves have children seldom enough that when an elven couple bring a child into the world, they often move nearer parents with another child or those expecting, just so the kids can grow up together. Omo and Elana were your only childhood friends, and though you&#039;ve largely gone your separate ways you still share that special bond. <br /><br />You find Omo chopping wood in his backyard, shirtless and sweaty. He is tall, even by elven standards, easily a couple hands higher than yourself. Unlike most elves, he keeps his blond hair cut short rather than gathered in a braid. His face would be handsome were it not for the prominence of the famous Thunderjaw chin- his eyes twinkle merrily as he sees you walk down the lane, and he leans back on his axe.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Ho, Nym! I&#039;d begun to think you&#039;ve been avoiding me! I haven&#039;t seen you in what, a week?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Hey Omo- has it been that long? Well, I&#039;ve been busy lately.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Oh? And what have you been busy doing? Teaching the fish to sing?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">As a matter of fact, I happen to be in the midst of preparations to leave the Vale.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Really, leave Yicelafo? Why?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I&#039;ve got it in my mind to travel. See the world, something beyond this forest and river.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Since when? You&#039;ve always been content to faff about doing this and that before now.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Well, that was then and this is now- people can change, you know.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Yeah, I know. Good luck getting the Elders to let you go- I&#039;ve asked to take trips out of the Vale myself, without much luck I might add!</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Actually, Pevo said he&#039;d speak to the Elders on my behalf.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Pevo Zephyrtempest? I didn&#039;t realize you two knew each other that well.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Well, we&#039;ve been chatting for the last week or so. He&#039;s partly my inspiration to travel, and he seemed supportive of the idea- he even gave me a bit of spending money.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Oh did he? It figures, I suppose- I&#039;m sure if I had perky breasts like yours I&#039;d get all kinds of nice things.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">You&#039;d look pretty funny with big breasts under that big chin- one might be mistaken for thinking you had no neck!</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Ha! I suppose I would, at that. Say, Nym, as long as you&#039;re pulling strings to get out of Yicelafo, how about you pull one more and take me with you?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">What? I thought you were training to be a Ranger.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Half the reason I became a Ranger in the first place was so I could wander out along the borders of the Vale- every patrol, I see the horizons outside the forest and wonder what&#039;s on the other side. Besides, you&#039;ll certainly need my help! What do you say?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I...</span><br /><br />On the one hand, Omo is right- a trained Ranger (well, half-trained, anyway) would be a valuable companion on the road, and the Elders will probably be more amendable to your journey if you have a partner. On the other hand, Omo doesn&#039;t know about your unique talents, and you don&#039;t know how he&#039;d respond to the knowledge. Necromancy nearly caused the extinction of your race, and that&#039;s the kind of thing nobody can take lightly. Hiding your talents from a traveling companion would be extremely difficult.

Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-If you ever have enough spare mana, see if you can control multiple dead crayfish at once, and if there&#039;s an upper limit on how many perspectives you can hold at once. Stop if you get a headache, feel dizzy or anything else seems strange.<br />-See what the maximum range is for controling one of your zombies, and if it expands with practice. May take more than a day of effort, but it&#039;ll be good exercise.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments.

That was more Elana&#039;s speed. As it rather looks like Omo will be joining the party, he&#039;ll get a rough character sheet next update.<br /><br />Speaking of next update, you&#039;ve got a Mana potion, and Omo has an axe- any final votes on how to resolve your tree situation?</div>

If it&#039;s a choice between freezing to death in the woods or harvesting living wood, Elves will take the wood, but they&#039;ll feel super guilty about it, to the point of seeking out the tree later to tend to it.

We don&#039;t want to be going over maximum and wasting good potion.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />As you set off to tend to your own woody problem, you realize you never asked Pevo how much Mana your potion was good for. Well, it&#039;s not like Stealing Vitality costs all <em>that </em>much- surely if this potion is potent enough to help Ari in his tasks, it will be sufficient for your own. ...Right?<br /><br />It is late afternoon by the time you return to your grove- beneath the thick canopy, it may as well be sunset. As you had feared, you are aware of the purple glow well in advance of your actual arrival. Carefully, you sneak around the trees, your inexpert eyes searching for signs that another Elf has been here. You gradually spiral in to the tree itself without seeing any elves, nor sign of their passage. As you regard the tree, you decide to indulge in a brief experiment before extinguishing its merry flame.<br /><br />You harvested Rocky some time ago, but the Rope Doll is still where you left it. Picking it up, you start beating the tree with it, eyes peeled for any unusual effects. The rope flails against the tree much as any other rope would have- that is to say, ineffectually. The mere presence of Vitality in the doll does not appear to have any significant effect on its killing potential. Ah well, the attempt didn&#039;t cost you anything.<br /><br />Stepping back, you unstopper your Mana potion. Your nose twitches again at the fruity, pungent odor. You slowly begin drinking the potion, taking care to keep in mind your Mana pool so you can stop when you have enough for the task at hand. It tastes extremely strange: fruity and sweet, but a little spicy, while the texture is grainy without being gritty, and thick.<br /><br />As you drink, you can feel a pleasant, comfortable warmth spreading throughout your body. More importantly, you can feel your magical energy returning! Not nearly as much as you&#039;d like, however, and as you drain the last drops you seem to max out at about 3 Mana. Maybe a quarter of what you&#039;re capable of, but enough for the task at hand.<br /><br />You stretch out your hand towards the Undead Oak, and <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Steal Vitality</span></strong></span></span>. Your magics scour the Oak clean, and the purple flames flicker and die. However, you drain a much smaller amount of Vitality than you had expected- not even enough for 1VP! You&#039;d rather hoped that this method of tree-destroying would have alleviated the ache in your bones. Come to think of it, though, you don&#039;t really feel that ache anymore anyway. That&#039;s a plus.<br /><br />You rub your eyes- it feels like this day has taken <abbr title="18 days, to be exact :P">weeks</abbr>, you&#039;ve emptied your Mana reserves, replenished and emptied them again, and it seems you&#039;ve walked the length of the Vale twice over. You want nothing more than a warm bed and a good night&#039;s sleep. As you rise to leave, you notice your Rope Doll&#039;s eyes twinkling as it rests on the rock you left it on.

I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow.

See if it destroys it. cut off a limb, and see if the life stays in the body or the limb. Then cut off the head, and see if the head remains alive. Find the smallest bit that can remain undead.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Although tired, you&#039;ve never been one to pass up an opportunity for experimentation, and this shouldn&#039;t take long.<br /><br />You fumble at your belt for a moment before drawing your knife, then lay the Rope Doll on the rock, face up. Lifting one of the &quot;arms&quot; you saw at the rope until it falls off. For a moment it maintains its faint purple cast before it fades back to a regular piece of rope. Your Necromantic Sight reveals a negligible dip in the Doll&#039;s Vitality. Hacking off the other arm yields a similar result.<br /><br />Starting just below the head knot, you saw at the rope, severing the body from the head. The body &quot;dies&quot; much like the arms did- the Head remains animate. However, you note that the head (at this point a glorified noose) now only contains One Vitality, instead of the Two the whole Doll had. You slice through the top of the head loop, and the rope falls apart, the eyes winking out and the phosphorescent fire fading. The Rope Doll is destroyed.<br /><br />Something about this strikes you as very sad, and fighting back tears you pile up the pieces of rope on the remains of Rocky. After a moment&#039;s consideration, you arrange the rope in a semblance of it&#039;s brief unlife- er, undeath? Animatedness. You are abruptly aware of how silly this is, internally debating semantics over the current nonliving status of a rock and piece of rope that were never properly alive to begin with, and certainly never had anything resembling a thought pass through them! You start giggling to yourself- Here lies Ropey the Rope Doll, may she rest in Pieces! Ha, see, it&#039;s funny because Ropey is in little chunks now.<br /><br />You realize that you&#039;ve been giggling to yourself in the dark for a while now- you aren&#039;t precisely sure how long, but it has certainly been longer than anyone should giggle while alone. The part of you that is rather concerned with things being precisely right suggests that this may be cause for worry, but you counter by suggesting nothing has been precisely right for a solid week now, so kindly shove off.<br /><br />Oh right, shove off- you were going home now. Yes, that is a good plan. You jump to your feet to act on that plan and promptly fall on your bottom. You realize that might have gone better if you were sitting in the first place, but now you can do this properly. Jumping to your feet- well, to your knees, then you need a hand on Rocky to get the rest of the way- you exit the Grove. It is well and truly dark now, and though the sky was tinged with red in the Grove, here beneath the canopy it may as well be midnight.<br /><br />It should only be about an hour back to your home, but it feels like it takes twice that, stumbling through the woods, tripping on roots and walking into branches. Then again, it almost feels like no time at all, so that averages out, right? You very very carefully climb the steps, but have trouble with the door, as you aren&#039;t quite sure where the latch is. Come to think of it, you aren&#039;t quite sure where your fingers are. Hang on a second.<br /><br />*<span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><em>bleeearrgh</em></span>*<br /><br />There, much better. After a few moments, you manage to get the door open. With a great laugh at the puny door and its failed attempts to stop you, you shamble inside, collapse on the bed and instantly fall asleep.<br /><br />...<br /><br /><br />You awaken the next morning dead. No, scratch that, you just wish you were dead. Your mouth tastes like socks, your clothes are rumpled and sweaty, and you have a <em>pounding </em>headache.

That&#039;s strange. The mana potion seemed to have the same effect on you an alcoholic beverage might have on a human. <br /><br />Are the elves familiar with alcoholic beverages? Are there any drinks less-than-graceful elves quaff away at in the night? It might help us understand the nature of this potion we have yet to find out how to make.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You roll over and stuff your head beneath a pillow, away from the stabbing light of day. You haven&#039;t felt this hungover since the morning after your coming of age party. Your thoughts keep churning, despite the headache- is this a result of casting from Vitality? Maybe the workout you gave your Mana pool? Some other Necromancy related shenanigans? Actually, you first remember feeling off right after that Mana potion...<br /><br />Wait a minute- that fruity taste... Sunberry! You hadn&#039;t recognized it at the time, what with the spiciness and strange texture, but you&#039;re reasonably sure the base of that potion was Sunberry Wine- a rather potent potable, as such things go. Elves- like most races- freely partake of alcoholic beverages, though they favor wines. Sunberry Wine, in particular, is a traditional Elven beverage, and the berries grow only in the Vale. It is famed for its strength and unique flavor, and is Yicelafo&#039;s prime export.<br /><br />But that still doesn&#039;t explain the spicy taste, or the texture, and it only raises more questions. Do Mana potions need to be made of booze? Does the process of making a Mana potion make booze stronger? Is that why Humans buy the potions- for the side effects?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2861460#msg2861460">Quote from: GlyphGryph on Wed 28-12-2011, 16:46:52</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Maybe it was a side effect of draining our mana reserves completely twice in a row, though. Anyways, since we&#039;ll be seeing our mage friend on the way out, I imagine, we can ask her when we get there. Also, we should send her a letter letting her know we&#039;ll try to visit on our way to the outside, and we should try to visit.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You think it would be a good idea to visit Elana Foundwasps, and resolve to write her another letter. You remember, however, that you haven&#039;t heard a response from your last letter- maybe your messenger delivered the other letters first, or perhaps she&#039;s already at the Fair. You haven&#039;t heard back from your parents, either, although it is a good bet that your Father is leading the Caravan&#039;s escort through the Vale.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2860090#msg2860090">Quote from: Cellmonk on Wed 28-12-2011, 02:48:42</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I guess we need to meet Omo.. tomorrow was it? We should get all our supplies ready. Fishing equipment, A hatchet, I&#039;m not sure how skilled we are at archery, but a bow and some arrows might come in handy. We also should bring a tinderbox, unless we can start fires with magic, or elves have knowledge in white phosphorous. We want plenty of flatbread, some lemons to avoid scurvy, and some salt just in case we find ourselves far from the coast. We need a flask for water (other than our potion vial, which we may find another use for). We also need plenty of rope, some leather to wrap our feet in if it gets cold (and to experiment with), and some herbs in case of injury. We want a frame to pack this all onto, and a leather bag to mount on the frame and sleep in. A shortsword might come in handy, but it might be a bit expensive, and isn&#039;t a necessity. If we have or can get our hands on a larger knife or sword, we should find a light one. We don&#039;t want to weigh ourselves down too much. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Eventually, you muster the effort needed to get out of bed. After addressing some basic hygiene needs (you&#039;ve got a nasty bruise on your shin, by the by,) you decide to do some preparation for your eventual departure from Yicelafo. You don&#039;t have a specific meeting planned with Omo, just the intention to join him at the Fair before asking the Elders permission to leave. Still, you&#039;d like to be ready to go when you do get permission.<br /><br />You start with the items you already own- starting with a large leather backpack, you start filling it with your <abbr title="Fishook, line, and lures">fishing equipment</abbr>, flint and steel, a waterskin, and a change of clothes. Alright, two changes. You should be able to buy traveling food for about 5 copper/day, lemons and salt for a few more. A good hatchet can run as high as 6 silver, but maybe you can haggle for a used one. You don&#039;t have a clue how much various herbal remedies cost- you&#039;d have to consult a healer. A bedroll will probably run you a silver piece. Silk ropes would be ideal since they are both lighter and stronger, but are too expensive- Rope Reed fiber ropes cost 2cp/5ft, and you could pack a coil of 50 feet without too much trouble.<br /><br />A shortbow and arrows would be nice, but is out of your price range- they normally sell for something like 30 silver. A shortsword, though requiring considerably less craftsmanship than a bow, is similarly expensive due to the general lack of metal in Yicelafo. A good, reliable metal dagger will probably run you 4 silver in the Vale. Both the shortsword and dagger will probably be cheaper if you buy from the Caravan at the Fair, though the sword likely won&#039;t drop into your price range.<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Current Shopping List</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><em>In order of priority,</em><br /><strong>Trail Rations</strong> (3 days) (1.5 sp)<br /><strong>Bedroll</strong> (1 sp)<br /><strong>Rope Reed rope</strong> (20ft) (0.8 sp)<br /><strong>Hatchet</strong> (lower price the better) (&lt;6 sp)<br /><strong>Healing Herbs</strong> (?)<br /><strong>Dagger</strong> (4 sp)<br /></div></div><br />Does that list look right to you?

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-If you ever have enough spare mana, see if you can control multiple dead crayfish at once, and if there&#039;s an upper limit on how many perspectives you can hold at once. Stop if you get a headache, feel dizzy or anything else seems strange.<br />-See what the maximum range is for controling one of your zombies, and if it expands with practice. May take more than a day of effort, but it&#039;ll be good exercise.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-Make a zombie insect that will stand still, then see if we can take its vitality when it is behind a rock (out of our line of sight).<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />-Finally,&nbsp; We have silver on us. we should test how it reacts with our magic. Can we put vitality in silver? what happens if we drop a silver piece through a Golem&#039;s head?<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Yicelafo<br /><a href="http://img.ie/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/6.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

It is nearly midday now, so it would be approaching sunset when you arrive. The Caravan Fair is basically Elf Woodstock, and a shantytown of tents and campsites will steadily grow around the city throughout the week. Omo probably has a tent set up somewhere if you feel like meeting up with him, or if you don&#039;t feel like &quot;roughing it&quot; in the mild Yicelafo night you can probably crash at your Mother&#039;s house in the city.<br /><br />The river closer to Yicelafo will be more densely populated than your home village, but the paths will be unusually full of other Elves going to the Fair. The traffic will only get worse as the week goes on.</div>

						<div class="inner" id="msg_2865035">I will note that your belt knife is basically a small, dull dagger- a new, larger dagger would be a much more effective weapon, if it comes to that.<br /><br />As far as writing materials goes, your best bet is either Parchment(2 cp/sheet) + Charcoal/Chalk (1 cp/10pc), a Wax tablet (1sp), or a combination of the two. If you indulge in a Scroll Case (1 sp) you will negate the slight chance that your charcoal/chalk writings will be smudged beyond legibility, besides being generally more organized.<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Longwinded Explanation</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">Ink is the most permanent solution for writing needs, but is a bit out of your price range at 8 sp for a vial. Charcoal is definitely the most economic solution, as a copper will get you ten sticks- chalk is a similarly priced alternative that is more difficult to read on paper/parchment, but easier to read on, say, a cave floor. Both have a tendency to get smudged, though this risk is readily negated with a Scroll Case (1 sp). <br /><br />Paper is unknown to the elves (as the process requires a lot of wood,) but Rope Reed Papyrus serves the same niche. Elven Papyrus is extremely high quality, but it is still less flexible than paper, and can only be inscribed upon with ink. But isn&#039;t the added expense and hassle worth saving poor innocent trees? A single sheet of Papyrus will cost 4 cp.<br /><br />Parchment is the commonly accepted alternative to Papyrus among the Elves. On the one hand, it has a noticeable odor, is more affected by humidity and extreme heat or cold, and needs good maintenance to keep ink from fading over the years- on the other hand, it is cheaper and widely available. Parchment costs 2 cp per sheet.<br /><br />A Wax Tablet is a wooden tablet covered with wax, and comes with a cover and stylus. It is reusable, making it ideal for notes, quick arithmetic, or (small) maps, and whatever is written on it is well protected- however, you basically only have 2 pages worth of space to write things before you have to start erasing old stuff. Pretty much all scribes and secretaries will carry these.<br /></div></div></div>

I think, experimentation wise, we could do with laying low for a little while. And everyone we need to talk to and everything we need to do is there. Since we know we can use our magic on things we can&#039;t see (remember raising the crayfish), we can do some simple magic on the walk so as not to worry about it expressing itself during the night. Concentrate on trying to understand it, focus it, notice the details. Nothing particularly new or experimental, just going over what we know and see if we notice anything new.<br /><br />Some simple spells we can cast on the walk:<br />Get some more dead crayfish or something else fairly whole in a bag.<br />Insure we can raise them through the bag like we did that night, but keep them in the bag. See if we can raise two at once.<br />How do they interact?<br />Command them both to remain still and calm. We haven&#039;t done much commanding, so pay careful attention to the experience.<br />Drop some silver in the bag and see if they react.<br />Finally, attempt to &quot;Alter Golem&quot; on one of the zombies. Is there anything we can change? Can we mash them together and make them one zombie?<br /><br />That should easily drain most of our mana for the day, and it&#039;s all stuff we can do on the walk without being obvious about it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You decide to take a break from running around in the woods by yourself, and take a trip to the Caravan Fair. Omo is probably already there, and you don&#039;t want to spend your limited cash without consulting with him first- besides pretty much anyone who is anyone will be there. After all, the Fair is the social event of the season! Songs will be sung, dances danced, strange items and stranger tales from the outside world put on display, and various mind-altering substances will be readily available for those so inclined.<br /><br />Although, this is not to say you won&#039;t be doing some experimentation. After all, it would be most embarrassing to suffer Mana buildup in the midst of the greatest gathering of Elves short of the Fall Fair. The crayfish you already had are back at your little Grove (and probably rotted to goo, come to think of it,) but you know of a little pool not too far away that is too small to support larger fish, but is a ready supply of crayfish, toads, and other little creatures suitable for bait.<br /><br />You easily net a pair of minnows, and let them air-drown on your way back to your home. Hesitating a moment, you decide to wrap them in a rag before putting them in your pack, sandwiched between your spare clothes. Securely buckling the pack shut, (after preparing a meal for later,)&nbsp; you set off on your journey to Yicelafo.<br /><br />Heading to the river, you walk westward along the bank. Elves aren&#039;t much on making roads, but between the frequent traffic and tall trees there isn&#039;t much undergrowth along the river&#039;s edge, making it the fastest way to Yicelafo if you don&#039;t have a boat. After you get about half an hour outside village limits, you feel alone enough to attempt some subtle Necromancy.<br /><br />Focusing on the minnows in your pack, you attempt to Raise Zombie- no dice. Frowning, you think harder- you picture how they looked in the rag, imagine them pressed down by the weight of your clothing in the dark of your pack, and you <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Raise Zombie</strong></span></span></span>. You spend 1 Mana, although you don&#039;t feel any different. Casually, you unshoulder your pack, holding it in front of you- although you don&#039;t see any direct light, your Necromantic Sight informs you of the existence of a source of Necromantic energy within the pack.<br /><br />Continuing along the riverbank, you shoulder your pack and try to imagine what it is like to be a minnow. You are long, you are swim, you have little fins and are half tail, you are wedged in a rag in a sack, and you <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Command Undead</span></strong></span></span>. You gain that peculiar double vision- before you you see the woods, the river flowing by, an elf in the distance, but you are also aware of cloth and dark and a nearby dead fish. The undead minnow is flopping about, and you silently command it to remain still. Carefully looking through the minnow&#039;s eyes, you are reasonably certain the minnow is still fully wrapped in the rag- good thing, too, since you&#039;d rather not have your clean clothes smell like fish.<br /><br />You amicably nod to the elf as she passes, and she smiles back at you. Whistling a jaunty tune, you continue upriver with your passenger, passerby none the wiser!<br /><br />Once you&#039;re alone again, you prepare to raise the second minnow. You hesitate a moment- you&#039;ve been maintaining the Command Undead spell on the first minnow, and you aren&#039;t sure whether you can cast a different spell while doing so. There&#039;s one way to find out!<br /><br />You aren&#039;t in any rush, and carefully think about what you want to do, while maintaining awareness of the current minnow. When you feel prepared, you <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Raise Zombie</strong></span></span></span>. Through the eyes of your current minnow, you happily watch fire erupt from the other minnow&#039;s eyes, and it begins to jerk about in a mockery of its last moments of life. It appears to take no notice of its traveling companion.<br /><br />You try to shift your awareness to it, but cannot. Thinking for a moment, you carefully cast <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Command Undead</span></strong></span></span> while maintaining control of your first minnow. You gain a general awareness of the other minnow, but you don&#039;t gain its perspective. You try to order it to be still, but fail. Thinking a moment, you try to shift your awareness again- this time, you succeed! You maintain a general awareness of the first minnow, but now you see through the eyes of the second minnow. You order it to be still, and it complies.<br /><br />As you walk along, you try different experiments as it strikes your fancy. You try to directly control them both at once, but fail. You try to Alter Golem to merge them into one superfish, but fail. When you pause for <abbr title="Crusty bread and hard cheese">dinner</abbr>, you take a moment to poke them with a silver coin, with no noticeable effect.<br /><br />After dinner, you decide to do some testing of the range of Command Undead. As you walk away from your pack, your awareness of the minnow (both through Control Undead and Necromantic Sight) begins to drop off rapidly- once you get more than a couple yards away from your pack, the spell ends along with your Necromantic Sight&#039;s awareness of the minnow&#039;s existence. Returning to your pack, you sense the minnows again, but don&#039;t regain control of them.<br /><br />As you consider the results of your experimentation, you continue upriver. You soon encounter more and more elves, some slower than you, some faster. Many of them carry a pack with camping gear, similar to yours. With the setting of the sun, you arrive at the outer limits of Yicelafo. On the north side of the river (the side you are currently on,) you see lights twinkle into being as the Arboreal City winds down toward the night. Across the river, similar lights at ground level betray the presence of the reveler&#039;s camp- somewhere on that shore the Caravan itself is also resting, resting before the renewed festivities tomorrow.<br /><br />You ponder where to spend the night. You could always crash at your Mother&#039;s house- she maintains an apartment in downtown Yicelafo. Meeting with her is probably going to require some catching up and explanation of your journey, explanation that you may want to put off until the next day. You could also seek out Omo or another of your acquaintances across the river for a no questions asked rest, or, given how clear the night appears, you could probably sleep in the open by yourself, perhaps a bit worse for wear since you lack a bedroll. You should also consider how (and if) you will dispose of your minnows.<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 9/10<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 6/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 17/20<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">6.6 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Belt Knife, Leather Backpack (Flint&amp;Steel, Small Empty Potion Bottle, <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2)<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Tired<br /><strong>Seven</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - you can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Necromancy</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Raise Zombie</strong></span></span></span>- ?

Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-Make a zombie insect that will stand still, then see if we can take its vitality when it is behind a rock (out of our line of sight).<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- Test Command Undead by commanding something you&#039;ve raised to self-terminate.&nbsp; &nbsp;A further test of this would be if it could work on the undead that other necromancers have summoned.<br />- Test Command Undead, and see if can you over-ride commands given to a zombie summoned by another necromancer.&nbsp; Does the zombie respond to the most recent order given, or does it have loyalty to whomever summoned it?&nbsp; Or maybe it is under the control of the more powerful of the two necromancers.<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Yicelafo<br /><a href="http://img.ie/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/6.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

						<div class="inner" id="msg_2877806">Alrighty then, didn&#039;t expect that course of action. For clarification, are you swallowing the minnow whole, or dissecting and eating the edible portions like the fish from way back in Part 2? And although I normally refrain from suggesting possible actions, I can&#039;t resist- are you casting Command Undead to &quot;accompany&quot; the fish on its way down?<br /><br />As a side note, if you were to drain both of them with Steal Vitality you&#039;d get 1 HP. This isn&#039;t very exciting apart from the potential Science to be performed, since you&#039;ll regain your last HP with a good night&#039;s sleep anyway. [The author does not guarantee that you will get a good night&#039;s sleep tonight or any night]<br /><br />As a bit of bookkeeping, I&#039;ve done a couple things. For those who haven&#039;t realized, the OP has links to each update in case you&#039;re just lurking for the story and don&#039;t feel like reading the suggesty bits. The new thing is that I&#039;ve added some rules to the second post. Nothing terribly exciting- think DnD but somewhat simplified to make it easy on me, and based on a d12. They mostly only apply to combat, so if you are thinking about suggesting violence as a solution to your problem you now have a means to evaluate how likely you are to succeed. Again, the vast majority of your suggestions will continue to be based on narrative logic.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also got an Equipment list up there so you can get an idea of what&#039;s available without specifically asking every time. Also so I don&#039;t have to refer to my notes, in the event I&#039;m away from the home computer, but that&#039;s really a side benefit. Lord knows we don&#039;t need <em>another </em>spoiler at the end of each update, and I&#039;m debating moving the Notable Figures bit to the Rules post as well. Definitely older maps, as they become less immediately needed.<br /><br />I&#039;ll probably throw up some overland travel guidelines and other junk like that eventually- timed events don&#039;t flow at the speed of Plot, so neither should travel. Any questions, inconsistencies, vagueness or typos? Speak up!</div>

Composing yourself, you cast <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Command Undead</span></strong></span></span>- it&#039;s easier now that you&#039;ve practiced, and you command one of the minnows. You command, <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Die</span>, but no response. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Cease, Still, End, Self-Terminate</span>... no luck.<br /><br />You decide to deal with the dead things the way any elf deals with a dead thing- eat it. Quickly, before anyone can see you, you scarf down the minnow. It tastes pretty terrible, what with being a cold raw minnow and all. There&#039;s a bad moment where you can&#039;t make yourself swallow it and it sticks in the back of your throat, but with supreme effort of will (aided by making the minnow &quot;swim&quot;) you manage to get it down.<br /><br />You are rewarded with one of the most singularly unpleasant and repulsive experiences you&#039;ve ever had. Although you lose the sensation of the minnow wriggling down your gullet after it gets through your throat, you can still sense its presence in your esophagus with your Necromantic Sight. You <em>think </em>you can feel it moving, but you&#039;re pretty sure that&#039;s just psychosomatic. From the minnow&#039;s point of view, you now know that your esophagus is a slimy, disgusting place that squeezes your food down and down. Soon the minnow hits your stomach, and you have a few moments to enjoy the sight of your half-digested dinner sloshing about before the acid melts the minnow&#039;s eyes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this does not kill the minnow- not right away, anyway. You are vaguely aware of the flesh of the minnow dissolving away- you are pretty sure most of the tail is gone by the time contact is severed, and your Necromantic Sight stops registering anything in your stomach. You are queasy, [8] but don&#039;t vomit. So that&#039;s something, anyway.<br /><br />The thought of trying that again- even without Command Undead in effect- turns your stomach. You decide to use your magic to eliminate the other minnow. This is a good time to knock off one of your planned experiments- leaving the minnow tucked away inside the bag, you focus on it and <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Steal Vitality</span></strong></span></span>. Success! You don&#039;t steal an appreciable amount of Vitality, but you kill the minnow (again) and now know that Steal Vitality does not require Line of Sight- not through cloth and leather, anyway.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2877231#msg2877231">Quote from: Grek on Wed 04-01-2012, 04:38:20</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We should probably go find Omo.

You walk further into Yicelafo, the path faintly illuminated by the lights in the treehouse windows above. At this hour, there are few travelers about, but you aren&#039;t alone when you get to the Canopy Bridge. The Canopy Bridge is the main thoroughfare between the North and South sides of Yicelafo, composed of a massive rope bridge anchored to two massive trees on either end, stabilized by ropes to the ground and other, smaller trees, and stretching whole across the Great River before dividing into a mess of smaller bridges and arboreal pathways.<br /><br />From your vantage point atop the South end of the Canopy Bridge, you can see campfires and tents stretching to the south, the shadowed late-night revelers moving from camp to camp. Looking for any given elf in the dark at this hour would be a difficult task, but you know Omo. When you reach the ground, you listen to the snatches of song drifting through the trees, and head in the general direction of the bawdiest, most enthusiastic chorus. Before long, you come to a sizable group of elves well into their cups, and it is easy to pick out Omo&#039;s tall figure among the celebrants.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Oy, Omo!</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Nym! Glad you could make it- come on, you&#039;ll have to do some serious drinking if you want to catch up!</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Nuts to that- let&#039;s head back to your tent and work out what we&#039;ll do tomorrow. I&#039;ve got a few things packed for our trip, but I want to know what you have.</span><br />Omo&#039;s face becomes sober. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Oh... you haven&#039;t heard. Come on, then, let&#039;s go.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Heard what, Omo?</span><br />Omo&#039;s only response is to press his mug of wine into your hand, and start walking away. The thought of alcohol makes you distinctly ill at the moment, and you run to catch up.<br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Omo! What haven&#039;t I heard?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">The caravan brought news. Bad news. The world&#039;s on fire out there, Nym- there&#039;s no way the Elders will let us leave.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">What? What happened? I know banditry was on the rise when the Fall Caravan came through, but hardly anything happens in human lands during the Winter.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">The banditry is worse now, so they say, and the monstrous races have been raiding in force. But that&#039;s not the worst bit- there&#039;s a Necromancer in Thrimesdur.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">WHAT!?! But... that&#039;s impossible! There&#039;s never been more than one Necromancer active at once, not since the War!</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Oh, you&#039;ve heard about the Necromancer along the Jeweled Coast then?</span><br /><br />Omo misses your dumbfounded expression as he stoops before a tent, lifting the flap and ushering you inside. It&#039;s a simple tent, plain canvas held up by sticks and a nearby tree trunk- more of a lean-to than a tent, really. You lay down your pack and lean against it as Omo fumbles the flap closed.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">So, yeah... between the Necromancers and the banditry and the fighting and all, we haven&#039;t got a hope of leaving.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Omo, I&#039;m tired and not thinking straight. Can you start at the beginning?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Well, nobody knows much about the Necromancer along the Jeweled Coast- nobody is really sure where he is, even, but he has united the Pirate Lords and is ravaging the coastal trade, so we hear. Apparently he&#039;s been doing this for some time, but only recently has it come out he&#039;s a Necromancer. The one in, er, Thrimesdur, that one&#039;s new. Some blighter from some random village, just started up and raising hordes of the undead. He was tricky about it at first, so nobody stepped on him when he was starting out, but now he&#039;s got a massive army marauding back and forth across the Empire.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Is anyone stopping him?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Last word is he smashed a huge Imperial Army led by the Emperor&#039;s son, and every fight he wins swells his forces. They say he&#039;s marching on the Capital, but rumor says he&#039;s actually heading this way, to the cities of the Great River.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Bloody hell! What&#039;s with the merriment!?! You&#039;d think there would be panic in the streets!</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">The hilarity is a bit forced- you can tell. I expect the Elders will call for full mobilization, mandatory conscription, seal the borders.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Are we going to war? I mean, out there- fighting by Man&#039;s side?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">I don&#039;t know, Nym. I just don&#039;t know. We&#039;ll talk about it tomorrow, I need to sleep now. It&#039;s been a long day.</span><br /><br />With that, he promptly curls up and falls asleep. You try to follow his example, settling with your pack for a pillow, but your mind is racing. Two <em>other </em>Necromancers? And apparently they&#039;re both thoroughly evil, or at least megalomaniacal- did they start that way? Were they like you, once?

Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- Test Command Undead by commanding something you&#039;ve raised to self-terminate.&nbsp; &nbsp;A further test of this would be if it could work on the undead that other necromancers have summoned.<br />- Test Command Undead, and see if can you over-ride commands given to a zombie summoned by another necromancer.&nbsp; Does the zombie respond to the most recent order given, or does it have loyalty to whomever summoned it?&nbsp; Or maybe it is under the control of the more powerful of the two necromancers.<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Yicelafo<br /><a href="http://img.ie/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/6.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

Reading the speculation is quite entertaining on my end, and you&#039;re getting very close to answering the fundamental &quot;what is necromancy&quot; question (which is not to say all your basic assumptions are correct, or that it is the only fundamental question you need to answer to master your arts.)

That might be seen as more natural than the zombie army route. We need to try to figure out how to make a golem that can move. I still stand behind trying clay automatons, and possibly jointed dolls. Just see whats needed to give the thing strength.<br /><br />An army of trees might be nice, too. Try raising a weed (that we left out in the sun till it died, say), and see if it can be given movement<br /><br />I think, from what we&#039;ve seen so far, that the creation of a golem is a different part of necromancy entirely. Remember the sadness we felt after killing the first rope golem? I wonder if we are in fact creating a sentient soul. In that light, I&#039;d feel bad about destroying any future golems, unless it is absolutely necessary. We should hide the ones we create, now that if they are found, they will probably be blamed on one of the two known necromancers running around. <br /><br />So many complicated ethics!<br /><br />Are there any stories about golems? Anything to draw some understanding from? Automatons perhaps? Pinocchio? Is there any way to ask an elder if past necromancers ever made minions which were not of flesh?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2890869#msg2890869">Quote from: joemoben on Mon 09-01-2012, 04:51:01</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">One more thing to note, I&#039;m pretty sure that 3 necromancers (The one at the Jeweled Coast and Thrimesdur and us) awakening at somewhere around the same time is strongly connected, and I&#039;m pretty sure the elders would have noted it also. This may lead to them guessing that there may be more popping up around the world. If they mention some kind of test at the conference, we should leave quickly.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As it turns out, Omo does snore- noisily. Hopefully it&#039;s just a byproduct of the wine. You toss and turn, your thoughts dashing about a hundred different subjects.<br /><br />You reflect on the Necromancer of Thrimesdur, whoever he or she may be. Why is it that every story that has a Necromancer in it involves that necromancer raising an army of corpses and going on a conquest spree? You&#039;d think there would be some variation- after all, almost all cultures have taboos about disturbing the dead, so why does it seem that such concerns never bother a necromancer? You know from first-hand experience that Necromancers can create golems, but such creations figure in only a few of the oldest stories, and are normally associated with the Dwarves, not Necromancers.<br /><br />Thinking of the sanctity of burial rites makes you philosophical. Desecrating graves and corpses is frowned upon because those bodies were once alive, but what is so special about life? Elves believe in a Spirit present in all living things- Humans believe that sentient creatures possess a Soul, with much the same purpose. Is the Spirit derived from Vitality, the presence of Life, or is it the other way around? Are you recalling the Spirit to animate the corpses you raise? Are you creating a Soul for the golems you create? There must be an answer...<br /><br />Golems- your golems haven&#039;t been particularly impressive thus far. A rock with no abilities, a rope doll with no mind or ability to move. It certainly seems odd you can raise a fish with the ability to see, hear, and swim about with less effort than it takes to make a rock hold Vitality and nothing else. They&#039;re both inanimate, aren&#039;t they? Why are the rules different?<br /><br />The other Necromancers might know, but then again, there shouldn&#039;t <em>be </em>other necromancers. You don&#039;t know how things were before the Golgothan War, but everyone knows that there were no Necromancers alive at its conclusion. In the intervening millennium, a handful of Necromancers arose independently in various locations, going on various world-conquering sprees with greater or lesser success before being inevitably defeated. One at a time, with hundreds of years separating them, not three at once. Maybe it&#039;s just random chance catching up with the world, or maybe there are more sinister forces at work.<br /><br />With that troubling thought, you fall into a restless sleep.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2881945#msg2881945">Quote from: GlyphGryph on Thu 05-01-2012, 23:12:28</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Okay, in my mind, leaving is now more important than ever.

You take advantage of the privacy to change your clothes, pondering your course of action. You are hesitant to leave without gathering more information, but you cannot risk being trapped in the Vale- the close quarters and strict discipline of Army life would likely not agree with your need to practice your Necromantic arts.<br /><br />You flip open the tent flap, stretching in the morning chill. Omo is tending a fire nearby, frying eggs and bacon in a pan. He motions you to take a seat on a comfortably mossy log and spills the contents of the pan into a small wooden bowl, and hands it to you before dropping more meat and egg into the pan with a sizzle.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Morning, Nym.

Well, you won&#039;t have to put up with that any longer- I&#039;ve thought it over, and decided to leave the Vale.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">What? Really?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Really- I don&#039;t know what is going to happen here, but I do know if I report in I&#039;ll be the most junior of the junior officers, a position that was unpalatable enough in peacetime. I neither need nor want that kind of authority and responsibility.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Great! I thought I was going to have to convince you to come with me, but this will be much cleaner if we go together!</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">I- together!?!

You aren&#039;t a trained fighter, you&#039;ve never spent two nights together sleeping beneath the stars, and you aren&#039;t particularly sneaky- if we run into bandits or monsters or, the Light forbid, the forces of the Necromancer, all you can do is get yourself killed.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Hey, I&#039;m not all <em>that </em>helpless. Besides, you have to take me with you.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Oh?

Why do you want to leave so badly?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Because I think we can do a lot more good out there in the world than cooped up here in the Vale.</span><br />Omo rubs his eyes. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Ah, burn me- fine. Please don&#039;t die on me.</span> He scrapes his breakfast into another small wooden bowl and begins eating.<br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Grand- what equipment do you have? We don&#039;t want to put off our departure any later than we must.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Mmm... well, I&#039;ve got some camping equipment, as you can see, and the know-how to make do with what we can&#039;t carry.

Oh, and my staff.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Your staff?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Yeah, hang on.</span><br /><br />Setting aside his breakfast, Omo unties a few ropes and the tent collapses in a heap. You realize that the staff Omo draws forth was being used to support the frame, but you&#039;re too distracted by the staff itself to give the tent&#039;s construction more thought. The staff is nearly nine feet long, made of a smooth, hard, dark wood you do not recognize. The ends are bound in a brass sleeve etched with a stylized leaf pattern. Omo beams at you.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Pretty sweet, huh? Standard issue for Elven Rangers. The wood is specially grown by the Mages to be extremely hard and durable- the brass really doesn&#039;t add much other than appearance, and making the ends a bit heavier.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Very impressive! Alright, so you&#039;ve got a weapon and a hatchet- got any rope?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">What do you think I was holding the tent up with?

How about healing herbs- poultices and the like?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">I&#039;ve got nothing- healer&#039;s kits are expensive, and normally I just hit up a Life Mage if I&#039;m feeling under the weather. Healing potions are expensive too, so those are out. If it comes down to it I can try to gather some herbs in the wild, but if it&#039;s anything serious we&#039;ll be better off finding a qualified healer.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Well, that cuts down on my shopping list a bit.</span><br />Omo goes back to his breakfast. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">So, what now?</span><br /><br />Good question. Every hour you delay could cost you when trying to escape the Vale. You could hit up the Caravan to finish your supplies and find out more world news, especially as regards the Necromancer(s). You could also try to get formal permission to depart from the Elders, if they can find the time to speak with you- you&#039;ll be able to find out their official position on the Necromancer problem that way, at least.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- Test Command Undead by commanding something you&#039;ve raised to self-terminate.&nbsp; &nbsp;A further test of this would be if it could work on the undead that other necromancers have summoned.<br />- Test Command Undead, and see if can you over-ride commands given to a zombie summoned by another necromancer.&nbsp; Does the zombie respond to the most recent order given, or does it have loyalty to whomever summoned it?&nbsp; Or maybe it is under the control of the more powerful of the two necromancers.<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Yicelafo<br /><a href="http://img.ie/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/6.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

It isn&#039;t so much worship as it is respect for a great Guardian of Life, but it&#039;s something. You know from listening to the merchants of the semiannual Caravan that Thrimesdur has a much more organized religious system, and that the cosmopolitan cities of the Jeweled Coast play host to a wide variety of theological beliefs and practices from across the world. You&#039;ve got the vague idea that most religions advocate one of the Magical Faiths Pevo talked about a while back, but you aren&#039;t sure how accurate that is. What does that even mean, Magic is Magic and Faith is Faith, right? Something to look forward to.<br /><br />Of slightly more immediate concern- <abbr title="fergus, lockman">Two</abbr> in favor of leaving immediately, <abbr title="Gryph, Cellmonk">Two</abbr> in favor of checking out the Caravan first for supplies and sticking around to hear the results of the Council (although I think lockman may be in the latter camp now.) Anywho, update will be up eventually. I&#039;d say tomorrow, but every time I do say it something comes up and pushes it back another day or three <img src="./Necromancer/7.gif" alt="&#58;P" title="Tongue" class="smiley" /></div>

How about I go take care of that, while you finish eating and pack up- we&#039;ll meet back here, alright?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Sounds like a plan- don&#039;t take all day though.</span><br /><br />Shouldering your pack, you leave Omo to his meal and head deeper into the Fair. It is early, but there is already a hustle and bustle as elves move about. Many of them are going to the Caravan themselves, hoping to beat the crush. Some elves are getting the day&#039;s celebration started early, and music and song drifts through the trees.<br /><br />After a few minutes of walking, you emerge from the forest into a massive clearing, and get your first sight of the Fair. The merchants travel in vehicles that are less wagons than miniature houses on wheels. Most of them are painted white, but splashes of garish color are evident throughout the assembly. Each wagon is drawn up a bit apart from the others, and is surrounded by tables and tents holding the merchant&#039;s wares. The net effect is that each wagon (or small group of wagons) operates as an island in a sea of elves, competing with one another to draw the largest crowds. Despite the early hour, many elves are already browsing the wares, and there is a general cacophony of feverish haggling, merchants advertising their wares, bellows of strange animals and the low roar of conversation and music associated with a massive group of elves.<br /><br />You join the mob, flowing with the crowd from stall to booth to tent, admiring the exotic wares. Fine silks from Dwarven lands are sold at a premium, as are strange spices and herbs from the Black Swamps. One booth has a wide variety of weaponry from across the world, halberds and enormous longbows from Thrimesdur hanging alongside Dwarf-made silver warhammers and steel battleaxes. A loud argument erupts between a merchant selling a fine glass figurine and the elf who (apparently) feels the Emerald dye he is offering is more than worth the cost.<br /><br />But enough sightseeing- you&#039;re here for business! A bit of wheeling and dealing later sees you in the possession of 2 days of Trail Rations, your own Bedroll, 4 sheets of Parchment, 10 bits of charcoal and a plain (but sturdy) Scroll Case, all for a grand total of 3 silver and 9 copper, leaving you with 2.7 silver left over.<br /><br />As you shop, you also keep your ears peeled for news of the outside world- the talk of the Caravan is all about the Thrimesdur Necromancer. After talking with a dozen merchants, laborers, and caravan guards, you learn that although few agree on his origins, all agree that Curo Nightroars first came onto the world stage when he took two dozen zombies armed with rusted old swords, pitchforks, and torches, and razed a small village in the middle of the night, shortly before the Winter Solstice. When the local Baron received word from the survivors, he sent messengers to his neighbors and rode forth to squash him- when his neighbors arrived to help, they were confronted by a small army of the undead led by the bloated corpse of the Baron. They were overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of the undead, and those who did not flee were slain.<br /><br />As winter grew colder and harder, the various barons and counts who mustered armies were unable to march in the ice and muck- a problem that Nightroars did not suffer. He sacked several more towns before he turned his growing horde against the encamped nobility- reports indicate that they were overcome by the great number of undead as well as by crippling morale problems. By the time the Spring thaw arrived, Nightroars had razed a number of small cities on his march north from the coast. He was confronted by the Duke of Mesmmori, the son of the Emperor, commanding the Imperial Army- somehow, even lacking a distinct numerical advantage, Nightroars crushed the Imperial forces and added their corpses to his own horde.<br /><br />Few who come into contact with Curo Nightroars or his undead army live to tell the tale, and with no organized resistance there is no telling which way he has gone. The popular belief is that he has marched to the Capital to dethrone the Emperor himself- others say that he is marching towards the rich cities of the Great River, and a few insist he is building himself a city of his own, the seat of a new Undead Empire.<br /><br />When you redirect conversation towards the other Necromancer, you receive much less information. Nobody knows his name, only referring to him as the Pirate King. His existence has been speculated at for a few years now, as pirate raids became more coordinated and effective. He was not known to be a Necromancer until this winter, when a band of skeletons proved instrumental in a daring pirate raid that stole a dozen warships while they lay at harbor. Nobody knows his agenda or home base, but he apparently has allies among the living Pirate Lords as well a prominent band of Lizardfolk mercenaries.<br /><br />Apart from that, you don&#039;t get much more than Omo gave you in his summary- banditry is rampant the world over, the monstrous races are increasingly aggressive, evil creatures of the night are arising, so on and so forth. The Caravan folk are clearly nervous about all of it, the listening elves less so- it all feels rather removed from the quiet simplicity of life in the Vale. With your new items carefully stowed away, you begin to pick your way back through the crowd, back to Omo. As you reach the edge of the Caravan, however, you catch a flash of purple out the corner of your eye. Turning, you face a low tent filled with odd statues, figurines, and books.<br /><br />Against the back wall, an onyx medallion burns with Necromantic energy.<br /><br />You hesitate, then duck inside. The dim interior is laden with a great many strange objects, most of them bearing the weight of ages. One other elf is examining a row of uncut gemstones on a table, and a youth gleefully inspects the skull of an exotic beast. The tent is otherwise empty, apart from the proprietor, a fat, greasy man with a scraggly beard.<br /><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>Hello, hello, welcome to my shop! What catches your eye, milady elf? If it isn&#039;t in this tent, it is not worth having!</strong></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I&#039;m sure. Actually, I was wondering about that medallion- it bears a strange engraving.</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>Yes indeed, yes indeed- I bought this piece from an associate of mine, who bought it from a lieutenant in the Imperial Army who, so the story goes, found it in the rubble he helped make of a goblin village.</strong></span><br /><br />As he speaks, the merchant lowers the medallion from its hook. Up close, it appears to have an engraving of two ravens with their talons entwined, inscribed in a neat circle. The etching appears to be inlaid with an unknown bluish metal, giving the medallion a smooth, reflective surface. To your Necromantic Sight, the eyes of the ravens blaze, as does the circle they are inscribed in. As he holds it up for your inspection, the air almost seems to pulse between you and it- or so it seems, as neither the proprietor nor the other elf take any notice.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">A goblin village, you say? Surely such craftsmanship is beyond them!</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>I agree with you wholeheartedly, milady, and it is my contention that this is a relic of ages past. It looks dwarf-made to my eyes. A fine people, the dwarves, and fine crafts they make! When my suppositions are confirmed by the artisans of the Jeweled Coast, I&#039;ll make quite a handsome profit selling it!</strong></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I see. And how much are you expecting to sell it for?</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>I hope for the world, but for its obvious beauty and age alone the piece is worth a hundred gold!</strong></span><br /><br />The merchant puts the medallion back on its hook, and tries to interest you in a vial of perfume- you humor him to deflect suspicion, but your mind is whirling. If that medallion is dwarf made, then the sky is green- dwarves are given to angles and hard lines, and the engraving is almost entirely composed of curves, spirals and circles. Whoever made it, you&#039;d wager anything that a Necromancer came into contact with it at some point. Could this be one of the Artifacts of Power that Ari Wetdawn alluded to, but for Necromancers?<br /><br />What to do now? You can still sense the medallion, even when not looking at it, and it seems to beckon with a promise of power. But how could you get it? You can&#039;t afford a tenth of his asking price! Perhaps it would be best to try and force the medallion from your thoughts, and just leave as planned. Although you haven&#039;t seen Elana, or anyone else you know yet for that matter...<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 10/10<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 12/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 19/20<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">2.7 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Belt Knife, Leather Backpack (Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, Small Empty Potion Bottle, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2)<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Awake<br /><strong>Eight</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - you can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Necromancy</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Raise Zombie</strong></span></span></span>- ?

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- Test Command Undead by commanding something you&#039;ve raised to self-terminate.&nbsp; &nbsp;A further test of this would be if it could work on the undead that other necromancers have summoned.<br />- Test Command Undead, and see if can you over-ride commands given to a zombie summoned by another necromancer.&nbsp; Does the zombie respond to the most recent order given, or does it have loyalty to whomever summoned it?&nbsp; Or maybe it is under the control of the more powerful of the two necromancers.<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Yicelafo<br /><a href="http://img.ie/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/6.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

But then I realized that we&#039;re probably going to end up trying to get it regardless, so I may as well propose an cunning plan that lets us do that <em>without</em> getting ourselves arrested.<br /><br />The first thing to note is that the medallion is almost certainly not worth 100 gold. The merchant doesn&#039;t know who made it, how old it is, where it&#039;s from or even that it&#039;s magical. He&#039;s clearly bluffing. Chances are we can talk the price down quite a bit if we try. The second thing to note is that we have a good way to make money: Mana potions. If we get Pevo to teach us how to make these, and he&#039;s already agreed to do so, we can raise the money to buy the medallion legitimately without anyone wondering why we were desperate enough to steal it.<br /><br />At this point, you&#039;re probably asking yourself, &quot;Isn&#039;t the merchant going to leave before we can get the money for the medallion?&quot; The answer to this is no. Why? Because we&#039;re going to go with the merchant, that&#039;s why! After we learn to make mana potions, we can go to the merchant (who&#039;s name we should learn, by the way) and ask him to sneak us out of the Vale in exchange for us coming with him and brewing valuable mana potions for him to sell. We can even invite Omo along on our adventure, if we think he&#039;d be up for it.<br /><br />So, here&#039;s the plan: Ask the merchant&#039;s name and if he&#039;d be willing to meet us back here tonight, after his shop&#039;s closed down for the night, to discuss a business deal. Then we go learn to make mana potions. Once we&#039;re done, go visit Elana, let Omo know that we&#039;re going to crash at our mother&#039;s tonight in order to escape his snoring and then meet up the merchant and offer him the deal. If he accepts, we&#039;re golden. If not, we can always try one of those other plans.<br /></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Seconded.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Thirded.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Quaded<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Quinted<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I will note that this plan will involve hanging around Yicelafo another week, and since the Caravan will be escorted out of the Vale under armed guard (led by your Father, no less) you&#039;ll probably need the approval of the Elders, or some other clever plan/workaround.

As long as we&#039;re on the subject, however, I&#039;ll say that you&#039;re fairly average in appearance by Elf standards.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- Test Command Undead by commanding something you&#039;ve raised to self-terminate.&nbsp; &nbsp;A further test of this would be if it could work on the undead that other necromancers have summoned.<br />- Test Command Undead, and see if can you over-ride commands given to a zombie summoned by another necromancer.&nbsp; Does the zombie respond to the most recent order given, or does it have loyalty to whomever summoned it?&nbsp; Or maybe it is under the control of the more powerful of the two necromancers.<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Yicelafo<br /><a href="http://img.ie/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/6.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

Then we go learn to make mana potions. Once we&#039;re done, go visit Elana, let Omo know that we&#039;re going to crash at our mother&#039;s tonight in order to escape his snoring and then meet up the merchant and offer him the deal. If he accepts, we&#039;re golden. If not, we can always try one of those other plans.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Leaving Omo to pitch his tent, you set off in search of Pevo and a potion-making tutorial. Considering it unlikely that Pevo would be sleeping beneath the stars, you figure the best place to start looking would be the main Temple of Yicelafo. Crossing Canopy Bridge, you make your way northward into the Forest Retreat- most of the homes are in the branches of the preternaturally large trees, though as it gets more densely populated you start passing homes and small market stalls on ground level. The grass here is soft and springy despite the tramping of hundreds of elven feet, and the air smells rich and clean even with the increased habitation.<br /><br />You shortly arrive at the Great Temple of Yicelafo- a massive structure nestled in the branches of an enormous Oak, connected via rope bridge to the surrounding trees, the center of <strong><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">Life </span></strong>in the Young Vale. Though similar in layout to your home temple, the Great Temple dwarfs it in every scale you care to apply. The broad, grassy area surrounding the trunk is often used for dancing and other celebrations, though now it only has a few elves communing with nature.<br /><br />Climbing the ramp that spirals about the trunk of the central tree, you ask after Pevo, and are eventually directed to the guest quarters- sure enough, you find Pevo here, reading a book on his bed.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Hey, Pevo!</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Nym! So nice of you to visit. Here for the Fair, I take it?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">That, and to ask the Elders permission to leave the Vale.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Hm. You&#039;ve heard the news?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I have.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">And you still want to go?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I do.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">I see. Well, if nothing has changed for you, then nothing has changed for me.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Really? I thought you might try to talk me out of it.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">There aren&#039;t many in the Vale as old as I am- if there is one thing my age has taught me, it&#039;s that everything happens for a reason, including your Wanderlust, I warrant.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Being old makes you a fatalist?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Heh- maybe it&#039;s just me. Well, I spoke with the Elders shortly after I arrived, and while I was at it I put in a good word for you. I don&#039;t know what good I did, but maybe you have a better chance than before.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Thank you, Pevo. Actually, so long as I&#039;m here, I was wondering if your offer to teach me to make Mana Potions was still good?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Certainly, certainly! Here, let me get my things.</span><br /><br />Pevo begins rummaging through drawers, pulling out mortar and pestle, a small pouch, an empty bottle, a bucket and a broad bowl. He hands you the bucket, and begins laying out the supplies on his dresser.<br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Alright, first thing&#039;s first- to make a potion you need liquid. Any will do, though I recommend something that isn&#039;t too thick, since the crystals will make it more difficult to drink as it is. There&#039;s a cistern down the ramp, big ol&#039; hatch in the ground, can&#039;t miss it.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Any liquid? I was under the impression you needed booze, since that Mana potion you gave me tasted like Sunberries.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Hah! So you DID drink it! Oh, that&#039;s funny- it was going to be a practical joke on Ari, but you seemed so enthused I couldn&#039;t say no.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Wait... so you got me drunk as a dwarf for a <em>laugh</em>?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">You insisted! That&#039;s why it&#039;s so funny! Hoho, oh mercy... well, what are you waiting for? Go get some water!</span><br /><br />You go retrieve a bucket of water, trying to decide whether to be angry. On the one hand, Pevo was grossly irresponsible and immature- on the other hand, you did ask for it. You decide that, for now, it&#039;s more important to preserve your dignity and learn how to make potions; you can dress him down later if you still feel mad.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Alright, Pevo, here&#039;s your water.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Grand! So, let&#039;s begin.</span> Opening the pouch, he pulls a small, purplish-pink crystal from it. <span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">This is a Crystal, an important ingredient in many magical enterprises and the most important part of Potion-making. The Crystals are what is going to hold the Mana you infuse the potion with. This shard will hold about 1 Mana, and since I&#039;d like to have a useful potion when I&#039;m done I&#039;ll be using 2 shards.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">So the potion will end up restoring 2 Mana, right?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Right. Now, I&#039;ll take my pestle here, and grind it up as fine as I can. We need to get it down to about the consistency of sand, so it&#039;ll dissolve properly. Technically, you don&#039;t need to get it that fine, but if you don&#039;t you&#039;ll have chunks of crystal in your potion, which will be tough to swallow at the very least.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">How big can you get away with? Say, if you were in a hurry.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">If you&#039;re in a hurry, you&#039;re in trouble because the important step is also the most time consuming. The biggest thing with size is, the Crystals are sharp, so if they&#039;re too large they&#039;ll cut you up pretty good- this is why you can&#039;t just infuse a crystal and eat it without any liquid at all. Here, you&#039;ve still got that empty potion bottle, right? Have a couple crystals, make your own alongside mine.</span><br /><br />You accept a pair of crystals and mortar and pestle and start crushing them- you find that the individual shards are fairly sturdy, but a smart blow will fracture them, and from there it&#039;s a chore of fracturing them smaller and smaller until you can properly grind them. Soon, you both have a fine, sparkly pink powder.<br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Alright, that should be good enough. Now, we&#039;ve each got enough powder for 2 Mana. It doesn&#039;t matter how much water this gets dissolved in- ideally, you want it to be enough that the potion isn&#039;t too grainy or sludgy, but not so much you have to drink a liter of the stuff just for 2 Mana. Most potion bottles are sized to provide a good compromise, unless you&#039;re making an outlandishly strong potion.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">How strong can you make a potion?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">There is no hard limit, but only half of the Mana you apply to the spell is going to be infused, and it takes longer the more Mana you pump into it. Here, fill your potion bottle with water, then sprinkle the powder in, like so. Then shake it good, get it all mixed up in there.</span><br /><br />You follow Pevo&#039;s example, and are rewarded with a sparkly pink drink. Swirling it around, it appears that the Crystal has dissolved completely.<br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Great- now the hard part. The crystals in that solution will absorb up to 2 Mana, but they&#039;ll do so <em>very </em>slowly.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">How slowly?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">A solid hour, probably. You need to release your Mana slowly, so that it can absorb as much of it as possible- like I said, you&#039;ll still lose half of the Mana spent just because you can&#039;t possibly release it that slowly. The annoying part of the process is that if you lose control of the spell, even for an instant, all your work will be wasted and you&#039;ll have to start from scratch.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">What, and get new Crystal too? Why can&#039;t you just start over from the Mana releasing part? Heck, why won&#039;t it hold the Mana you&#039;ve already put in over the previous 50 minutes?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">It&#039;s complicated- a Mage could give you the technical explanation, and might even use terminology you&#039;d understand, but the gist of it is that the Crystal can absorb Mana quite well, but the last bit of the spell involves &quot;sealing&quot; the Mana inside. The Mage who taught me said it was like filling a pouch with marbles and then sewing it shut so they don&#039;t spill out.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Wait, so if you&#039;re sealing the Mana in the Crystal, how does it get into your body when you drink it?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">You&#039;re a great one for questions, aren&#039;t you? I don&#039;t know, I just know that if you lose your concentration or botch the last step you&#039;ve wasted a great deal of time. Now, carefully- focus your energies, and slowly direct them at the potion.</span><br /><br />Following Pevo&#039;s lead, you gather your Mana and force it at the potion. It feels rather similar to when you manipulated raw Vitality, and you quickly get the knack of focusing it on your target. You can feel some small portion of it being absorbed, the rest dissipating into nothing. With effort, you scale your mana use back to the half and half point Pevo mentioned. It takes significant concentration, but you and Pevo are undisturbed. The hour seems to pass quickly, and finally Pevo demonstrates how to complete the spell.<br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">And that should do it! Well done- I didn&#039;t get it, my first time. But then again, I recall you had surprising magical potential, given your lack of innate talent.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Yeah- so this is worth 2 Mana, then?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Yes. A Mana Potion takes twice the Mana to make, and about half an hour per point of Mana, but the potion lasts indefinitely and is rather valuable.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">How valuable is valuable?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Oh, I&#039;d expect that potion right there to market for 50 silver. Bear in mind, most of that cost includes the price of Crystal- those shards were about 20 silver apiece. Still, the increased effort and relative lack of powerful magic users makes the more potent potions much more valuable- as I recall, you had 10 Mana when you were last tested? That means you can make a potion with 5 Mana, for 100 silver worth of Crystal, and sell it for, say, 140?

There are still a couple hours until sunset and your scheduled meeting with the merchant Luki Revereorder. In the interim, You could go visit your Mother and let her know you&#039;re staying the night, or you could try to find Elana Foundwasps- she&#039;s probably out in the encampment someplace, though it may be tricky to find her in the mass (and you aren&#039;t sure what all you want to say to her.) You might also want to spend an hour or two plotting with Omo- on the one hand, you want to visit the burned remnants of the Sacred Grove north of Thrimesdur, but on the other hand your plan to hitch a ride with the Caravan takes you in exactly the wrong direction. You should get that figured out.<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 10/10<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 8/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 19/20<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">2.7 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Belt Knife, Leather Backpack (Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2)<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Fine<br /><strong>Eight</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - you can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Necromancy</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Raise Zombie</strong></span></span></span>- ?

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- Test Command Undead by commanding something you&#039;ve raised to self-terminate.&nbsp; &nbsp;A further test of this would be if it could work on the undead that other necromancers have summoned.<br />- Test Command Undead, and see if can you over-ride commands given to a zombie summoned by another necromancer.&nbsp; Does the zombie respond to the most recent order given, or does it have loyalty to whomever summoned it?&nbsp; Or maybe it is under the control of the more powerful of the two necromancers.<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Yicelafo<br /><a href="http://img.ie/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/6.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

						<div class="inner" id="msg_2917616">I will note that the figures Pevo quoted you for potions are retail value- he&#039;s assuming you&#039;ll trade them directly to the consumer (e.g make potion in exchange for healing/food/shelter on the road.) Revereorder is going to resell them, so he won&#039;t pay full market value- something you can/will negotiate with him for, however. No, I&#039;m not pulling numbers out of my ass, I&#039;ve got a handy dandy spreadsheet to refer to.<br /><br />Anywho, something I&#039;ve been meaning to do for a while but haven&#039;t gotten around to- talk about the map!<br /><br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />That map. Now, this map is basically <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2819100#msg2819100" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">scribbled on a napkin</a>, so don&#039;t expect perfect accuracy, but it&#039;s good enough to be getting on with. Since we&#039;re discussing travel, I figure&#039;d I&#039;d better throw out a rough scale and some travel times for your deliberation.<br /><br />Thrimesdur- from river to river- is about 400 miles across, which is something like the width of Poland. To put it another way, traveling from one end to the other without any major interruptions would take you about 17 days on foot, 13 on a horse. Much like Poland, Thrimesdur is basically one big plain- rolling hills near the mountains, broad expanses of plains, and small, dense forests near rivers and the Black Swamps. From Yicelafo, it would be 300 miles (13 days) of walking to the Sacred Grove, barring poor weather, bandits, undead armies, so on and so forth.<br /><br />The Jeweled Coast is something like 300 miles from end to end, although none of the cities&#039; influence extends very far inland. Each city is rather unique, with its own system of government and resident population. It&#039;s only about 100 miles from Yicelafo to the nearest city, but since that journey is through thick, treacherous rainforest you&#039;re still looking at 6 solid days of travel on foot- sticking with the Caravan (and its associated carts and wagons) ups that estimate to 9 days, barring monsters, savage animals, hostile tribes of lizardfolk, severe weather, so on and so forth.<br /><br />I think that covers everything that might factor into the immediate &quot;east or west&quot; decision facing You, so I leave you to it.</div>

They are quite visible to Muggles, and shed visible light (so yeah, you could use them as weird-ass torches.)<br /><br />Necromantic Energy is considerably more intricate, and is present throughout the whatever-it-is that&#039;s been infused by Necromancy. It glows, but is only visible to you and your Necromantic Sight (and, if this amulet is any indication, anybody else with Necromantic Sight.) It does not shed light and is invisible to non-Necromancers. Looking back, &quot;blaze&quot; was a poor word choice for the amulet- I meant that the glow was very intense. It does not appear as flames. There is actually more to your Necromantic Sight than has yet been revealed, mostly because circumstances have put a brief hold on your experimenting.<br /><br />Anywho, my many-days-in-a-row of work are over, so tomorrow we&#039;ll be getting back on track. It looks like the immediate votes are for &quot;Meet with Omo, compare notes, get him to gather travel info,&quot; &quot;MOOOOOCH,&quot; and &quot;Thrimesdur and points East.&quot; This makes your meeting with the merchant less about traveling with him, and more about making money (hopefully enough for the amulet outright.)</div>

In no time at all you&#039;re back at the campsite, where Omo has reset his tent and started cooking dinner- vegetables cooked in Strawberry Wine, by the smell. Omo offers you a plate, and you gladly accept his hospitality.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">So, did you learn how to make mana potions?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I did- we should be able to make a fair bit of coin, from what Pevo tells me. I&#039;ve been thinking, though, that what I really want to do is visit the Sacred Grove. So, instead of traveling with the merchant, I was thinking we just stick around here for a few more days, anyway, and sell him some potions. Did you have a preference which way we should go?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">East, West, it makes no difference to me so long as there are new sights to see. I&#039;d rather leave now, though, while we can.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Oh? Have you heard something new?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Well, no, but it&#039;s all but certain the border will be sealed sooner or later!</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Or in other words, you&#039;re fidgety and just want to go. Well, how about this- while I&#039;m funding our trip, you listen around and try to find out what&#039;s happening. Keep your ears open for word about any big movements by the Rangers, things that could mean the border is sealed or we&#039;re mobilizing, things of that nature. Figure out some alternate escape routes, in case it happens suddenly. Didn&#039;t you have a plan in place to desert before I ran into you?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Yeah, I was just going to use my knowledge of the patrol patterns to sneak off. That was before we were at the brink of war, though, so there&#039;s certainly more patrols out than normal. If the border gets sealed, there will probably be stationary pickets and sentries to contend with, too.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Well, we&#039;ll figure something out. What are they going to do if we just walk away, shoot us?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">No, they&#039;ll probably wrestle us down, throw me in the stockade for desertion and... actually, I&#039;m not sure what they&#039;d do with you. Probably check you for mental illness of some kind.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">...Oh. Well. Thanks for dinner, I&#039;ve got a meeting to get to.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">See you tomorrow!</span><br /><br />Now that you&#039;ve eaten your fill, you head back to the Caravan Fair. The sun is setting, and elves are already setting up bonfires and barrels of drink while merchants pack their wares for the night. You find the merchant Luki Revereorder outside his tent, staking the flaps down. He waves as you approach, and straightens up.<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Hello again, milady... ah, forgive me, but I don&#039;t believe I ever caught your name?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Call me Nym, Master Revereorder. You sell a great many exotic goods- I&#039;d wager you also sell Mana Potions?</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Indeed I do, ah, Nym, and a great many other potions besides.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Grand- as it happens, I have need of some ready cash, and I can make potions stronger than what you&#039;ll find outside the Vale.</span><br />Luki&#039;s eyes glint. <strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Yes, yes, elves are quite magically adept, I know. How potent are your brews?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I can make them 6 Mana strong.</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">That strong? Are you a Mage?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">No, I am merely talented even by elven standards.</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">I see. Do you have your own supplies? Crystal, potion bottles and the like?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Well, no, but those materials should be readily available here at the Fair.</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Yes, but I&#039;ll be the one footing that bill. Let&#039;s see... how many potions are you willing to make?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I plan to be here throughout the Fair- that&#039;s what, five days? Five potions, assuming maximum strength.</span><br />Luki pulls out a small abacus, and starts doing some rapid math. <strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Figure sixty gold for the crystal, a few more for the potion bottles... alright, your best profit margin is in making the strongest available. Most human mages with your capacity can&#039;t be bothered to waste their mana on potions. I can offer you 36 silver for each potion.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">That&#039;s it?</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">I like you, so I&#039;ll give it to you straight. When I&#039;m reselling those potions, the lowest I&#039;m gonna go is 170 silver. A bit more than 120 of that is just the cost of Crystal- that leaves 50 silver of profit between me and you. I&#039;m giving you the lion&#039;s share, since like I said, most mages can&#039;t be bothered to make potions this strong. It&#039;s bad business to inadequately compensate a mage.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Well... alright.</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Grand. Stop by tomorrow morning, Nym, and I&#039;ll have some Crystal and a potion bottle for you.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Tomorrow morning, then.</span><br /><br />You walk off towards your Mother&#039;s home in the city, not in the mood for any more festivities. You&#039;re looking at 18 gold for your wages, a handsome profit- but nowhere near the asking price for the medallion. It appears unlikely you&#039;ll be able to drum up the cash to make anything like a reasonable offer.<br /><br />Your path takes you off the main roads, along narrow paths lit by the candles of nearby houses. Soon, you come to your mother&#039;s place- her apartment is spacious by elven standards, and occupies the second tier of a tree that plays host to three dwellings in its branches. Climbing the rope ladder, you knock and enter.<br /><br />Your mother looks up in surprise- seeing that it is you, her striking face lights up with joy, and she catches you up in a warm embrace.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">Nym! I didn&#039;t know you were in town! How long have you been here?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Not long, Mom, I only got in last night.</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">Well, come on, sit down- have you eaten?</span></strong><br />You take the proffered seat, an overstuffed cushion in a wicker frame. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I have, Omo set me up.</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">Such a nice boy. I was happy to hear you&#039;re trying to make something of yourself- I hope you take the opportunity to study with the Sages, now that your journey is interrupted.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">What? Did they seal the border?</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">Not yet, but I can tell you that&#039;s in the cards. The Elders will not risk another Necromancer destroying the Vale.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Ah, so there&#039;s still time to go.</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">What? Nym, you can&#039;t really be thinking of leaving in the middle of a war.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Well, why not? It&#039;s better than being cooped up here.</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">Nym! The only thing you can do out there is throw your life away!</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Because I&#039;m spending it better here?</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">Listen to me- I&#039;ve been privy to the Elders meetings, since the Mages are preparing for the use of war magics not seen since the Golgothan War, and let me tell you it is <em>bad </em>out there. There&#039;s anarchy in Thrimesdur, as the rabble lose confidence in the Empire&#039;s ability to protect them. The Jeweled Coast is toxic with maneuvering and politics- rumor has it some cities are considering alliance with the Pirate King! As if a Necromancer could be trusted.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Maybe...</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">Maybe what?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Nothing, I guess. Let&#039;s not fight- how&#039;s Dad?</span><br /><br />You pass the next few hours catching up- you haven&#039;t seen your Mother in some time, after all. You don&#039;t press the issue of leaving, sensing your Mother is not receptive to the idea- you still want to sleep here tonight, after all. It doesn&#039;t sound like she&#039;ll be supportive of your trip, however.<br /><br />It turns out your Father did escort the Caravan in, and in fact was here last night, but right now he&#039;s off giving orders to various Ranger garrisons and won&#039;t be back tonight. As the candles burn low, you head to bed, dropping your things in the guest room and quickly falling asleep.<br /><br />The only commitment you have for tomorrow is to make a potion for Luki Revereorder, a task that will consume a few hours but hardly the whole day. Should you try to win your Mother&#039;s support tomorrow morning? [if so, I&#039;d like something more specific than &quot;yes.&quot;] You could also try to get the permission of the Elders to leave, and you haven&#039;t met Elana yet. What to do, what to do...<br /><br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 10/10<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 8/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 19/20<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">2.7 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Belt Knife, Leather Backpack (Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2)<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Fine<br /><strong>Eight</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - you can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Necromancy</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Raise Zombie</strong></span></span></span>- ?

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- Test Command Undead by commanding something you&#039;ve raised to self-terminate.&nbsp; &nbsp;A further test of this would be if it could work on the undead that other necromancers have summoned.<br />- Test Command Undead, and see if can you over-ride commands given to a zombie summoned by another necromancer.&nbsp; Does the zombie respond to the most recent order given, or does it have loyalty to whomever summoned it?&nbsp; Or maybe it is under the control of the more powerful of the two necromancers.<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Yicelafo<br /><a href="http://img.ie/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/6.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

Or perhaps our mana-pool or whatever. Then we could make even better potions, and as we reach higher limits then the price should increase just about exponentially near the top. We currently don&#039;t know much about the potion market, but there&#039;s no reason not to <strong>ask the merchant</strong> about the world of potion trade. You know how, universally in all trade, high-end things are always ridiculously overpriced, even if they are only somewhat better than current standards.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>There&#039;s no point in making a potion that restores more mana then the mage can store.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s a valid point, sure, but you don&#039;t need quaff it down <em>all</em> at once. Take about as much as you need and save the rest for later! <br /><br />Also, Monk, if we make about a hundred potions we should be able to do so more efficiently, right? I mean, the speed at which we make potions or the concentration? [EDIT: Same thing lol]<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The speed at which you can infuse a potion is limited more by the absorption rate of the Crystals than by any particular talent on Your part. Hence, Brew Potion isn&#039;t a skill, it&#039;s a spell. Note that other forms of alchemy may have an associated skill.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2935704#msg2935704">Quote from: Rockowl on Fri 27-01-2012, 11:50:48</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And I was wondering if mana potions could be distilled. I can&#039;t imagine the crystal particles evaporating along with water. [EDIT: And even if they dissolve completely, like sugar in water, it should leave a higher concentration and eventually a crystallized residue.] This might not actually be the most profitable way of making potions but it&#039;s good to know. You could carry an extremely potent, high concentration potion, then pour it in a cauldron of water and start bottling and serving it in the marketplace. Not the most necromantic of experiments, but still, it&#039;s just good to know how it works.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Pevo</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It doesn&#039;t matter how much water this gets dissolved in- ideally, you want it to be enough that the potion isn&#039;t too grainy or sludgy, but not so much you have to drink a liter of the stuff just for 2 Mana. Most potion bottles are sized to provide a good compromise, unless you&#039;re making an outlandishly strong potion.<br />...<br />Technically, you don&#039;t need to get it that fine, but if you don&#039;t you&#039;ll have chunks of crystal in your potion, which will be tough to swallow at the very least... The biggest thing with size is, the Crystals are sharp, so if they&#039;re too large they&#039;ll cut you up pretty good- this is why you can&#039;t just infuse a crystal and eat it without any liquid at all.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So yeah, &quot;Brew Potion&quot; would be more aptly named &quot;Infuse Crystal.&quot; Distilled Mana Potion would basically just be infusing the powder and not adding liquid. The liquid is just there because the Crystal is wholly inedible. Dropping your Kool-Aid packet of Crystal worth 2 Mana in a cup of water results in a cup of 2 Mana, and dropping that same packet in a bathtub results in a bathtub of 2 Mana. This works basically as you might imagine.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2937236#msg2937236">Quote from: Felius on Sat 28-01-2012, 03:14:52</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2937213#msg2937213">Quote from: monk12 on Sat 28-01-2012, 03:05:13</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">So, looks like the current course of action is &quot;MOOOOCH,&quot; &quot;Meet with Elders,&quot; &quot;Meet Elana hopefully,&quot; and &quot;Negotiate with merchant.&quot; I will note that 100 gold is a lot of money- your parents are fairly well off, being public servants and all, but that&#039;s still like four month&#039;s pay even before you consider a fair amount of their compensation is in the form of food/housing.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>We are not mooching for 100 gold, just enough to complement a bit to haggle down the cost to the amulet to say, 25 gold at the maximum. <br /><br />Aside: We&#039;re getting stupendously well paid for the potions then, considering we&#039;re getting 18 gold pieces for 5 days&#039; work.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, you are being paid well- this is a consequence of being a magical elf girl. You started as a level one Elf Mage, which got you a 10/10 Mana Pool. A level one Human Mage would have more like 6/6. You gained a level and jumped to 12/12- the human would gain that same level and jump to 7/7. Elves have higher starting mana pools and higher mana growth, which means that you grossly outperform your human equivalent. Human wizards who put in the time and effort to match your mana pool normally don&#039;t need to waste their time and resources making potions for sale, which means that the supply of high-end potions is limited.<br /><br />That said, there is less demand for higher potency potions, which means it is easy to saturate (har har) the market. You could make a comfortable living traveling between big cities and selling potions, and in fact this is probably what Pevo thought you would do when he offered to teach.<br /><br />And finally, yes, your parents <em>could </em>make more money than they do, especially your Mother. Elves in general <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2795460#msg2795460" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">aren&#039;t terribly materialistic</a>, and your parents in particular put little stock in wealth, valuing community much higher.</div>

Rising, you find your mother making breakfast in the kitchen, and join her for a meal of fruit and cheese, exchanging pleasantries and talking of inconsequential things. She soon leaves to perform her daily duties as Mage. After freshening up, you head out into the morning gloom, pulling up the hood of your cloak against the cold, soaking rain.<br /><br />You squelch your way back to the Caravan Fair. Between the rain and the hour, there aren&#039;t many elves out and about, and the few you see are more concerned with their errands than with merry-making. You don&#039;t want to spend much time in the wet either, and press on to your meeting with Luki Revereorder.<br /><br />You find Luki within his tent, preparing to do business for the day. There are no other customers here at this hour- the medallion is hung in the same place as yesterday, its supernatural pull as strong as when you first saw it. Luki looks up from his busywork as you enter, and starts rooting around behind his table.<br /><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>Good to see you again, milady Nym! I have your supplies here- an empty bottle and enough crystal for a 6 Mana Potion. I&#039;ll pay you for the work upon delivery.</strong></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Thank you, Master Revereorder. Speaking of my pay, I&#039;ve actually had a thought on that. I&#039;ve taken a liking to that medallion you&#039;ve got there- how about, instead of the 18 gold I was going to receive for the potions I&#039;m making for you, I were to take the medallion instead?</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>Surely you jest! That medallion is an extremely valuable historical treasure- I could hardly part with it for that paltry sum.</strong></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Mmm. As it happens, I&#039;m something of an amateur historian- just looking at it, I can tell you it isn&#039;t dwarf-make like you think. See, dwarves are given to hard lines and sharp angles in their art, and that piece is all curves and circles. An oddity, it is; a treasure, it is not.</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>Hmph. I&#039;m certain that the appraisers along the Jeweled Coast will be able to do a better job of identifying it than you. Meaning no disrespect, of course.</strong></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Of course... but let&#039;s be reasonable. That medallion is a gamble, and you know you can make a handsome profit on my potions. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, right?</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>That may be true, but I have too much invested in that medallion to accept such a small amount. Not, I&#039;ll take my chances on the open market.</strong></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Too much invested? What do you mean by that?</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>It took quite a bit of convincing to get the original owner to part ways with the piece. I won&#039;t take a loss on it.</strong></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Uh-huh. What you mean is, you got taken for a ride on something you don&#039;t know the value of. If I were you, I&#039;d cut my losses and take the sure profit.</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>I&#039;m telling you, this is a valuable- nay, priceless piece of art, and it&#039;ll make me a fortune! I&#039;m certain of it!</strong></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Alright, no need to get excited about it. I&#039;ll be back later with the potion.</span><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2932499#msg2932499">Quote from: GlyphGryph on Thu 26-01-2012, 06:26:51</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I vote for asking the council as soon as possible - try to convince them. Offer to do diplomacy. To gather information, and then return. Offer to travel with a (different) caravan heading east. Note that one of the rangers has offered to escort and protect you if you leave. Focus on the benefits your trip can provide, especially if they give you some magical way to remain in contact with them (if such a thing exists, obviously!) If they turn you down, we&#039;ll know, immediately, that we need to change our plans. If they push the issue, don&#039;t just storm off - agree with them that they are correct, the issues they&#039;ve brought up are serious, and they&#039;re right - you will stay in the veil.<br /><br />Do a quick look around for Elana on the way - if we don&#039;t find her, so be it, but if we do, be glad to see her and tell her what&#039;s going on.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Stowing your potion supplies, you decide to meet with the Elders. You trudge back out into the rain, heading back to Yicelafo proper- you don&#039;t pass Elana on the way, and given the weather you lack the inclination to do much searching. The Elders meet in the Shrine- a small grove of trees and shrubs grown tightly together, their branches and leaves cunningly interwoven to shelter an open area about the size of a house. The Shrine is a sacred place used for powerful <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">Life</span> rituals, and doubles as a place the Elders can formally meet to discuss important matters.<br /><br />As you approach the Shrine, you are stopped by a pair of staff-wielding Rangers standing guard over the vine-shrouded entrance. One of them addresses you in a bored tone of voice.<br /><br /><strong>I&#039;ll tell you what I&#039;m telling everyone else, citizen- the Elders are dealing with the Necromancer threat, and they will announce their actions later tonight. There&#039;s no cause to be alarmed- go enjoy the Fair.</strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Actually, I&#039;m not here about that. I need to speak with them about leaving the Vale.</span><br /><strong>What? Huh. Well, hang on, I&#039;ll check if they can see you.</strong><br /><br />He ducks inside, and after a few minutes he returns and ushers you inside. You brush past the vines, stopping for a moment as your take in your surroundings. The interior is dim, lit by some kind of glowing moss growing along the tree trunks. In the center of the room is a large boulder covered in the glowing moss- atop it, the Eldest stands waiting. The rest of the room has no furnishings to speak of, and is filled with groups of elves- the oldest and wisest the Elven people has to offer, in large part composed of the Mages who make life possible and the Sages who hold the sum total knowledge and tradition of the race. They stand in small clusters, some conversing amicably, some debating, some arguing.<br /><br />The Eldest beckons you to a place before the boulder, and motions to the crowd for silence.<br /><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">Alright, alright- enough! We&#039;ve got something new to discuss for a while. This elf has a petition to make.</span> He gestures to you. <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">Speak your piece.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Um. Thank you Eldest. I&#039;m here to ask permission to leave the Vale. I&#039;ve had the inclination to leave and explore for a time now, and recent events have only strengthened my resolve. I feel it would be inappropriate for us- the Elves- to hide away from the world, especially during this crisis. I can act as an ambassador, showing the world our commitment to peace. I can send back information so we don&#039;t rely on foreigners for knowledge of outside events. I can strengthen the resolve of the humans against the threats these Necromancers pose. I&#039;m certain I could obtain an escort of like-minded elves to ensure my safety. There is little to lose by letting me leave, and much to gain.</span><br /><br />As soon as you announce your intention to depart, there is a quiet murmur, but no outcry like you may have expected- likely Pevo&#039;s influence at work. Additional mutters arise with each point you raise, until there is a general clamor after you finish.<br /><br /><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">I still don&#039;t like it! With the Necromancer threat, we need to marshal our strength here, at home!</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">There is wisdom in her words, and precedent- Yicelafo sent delegations to help combat the necromancer Aban Dippedrumors some four hundred years ago-</span><br /><span style="color: teal;" class="bbc_color">Dippedrumors was active hundreds of miles away- Nightroar threatens us here, now! We can&#039;t afford to draw his ire-</span><br /><span style="color: navy;" class="bbc_color">We&#039;ve already drawn his ire by being who we are!</span><br /><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">An ambassador would help rally Thrimesdur against Nightroar, and could help sway the Jeweled Coast against the Pirate King-</span><br /><span style="color: teal;" class="bbc_color">The Pirate King already has his allies amongst the humans, despite the history of his ilk! How can we trust them to keep faith with us?</span><br /><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">We can only rely on ourselves- Yicelafo is strong, if we stay united! We can defeat them alone!</span><br /><span style="color: #666666;" class="bbc_color">If we cannot rely on the humans for support, how can we rely on them for information? This only increases the need for spies-</span><br /><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><strong>ENOUGH!</strong> Nym has raised important questions- we should take the time to consider them calmly and rationally. We will send for you, Nym, when we have reached our decision.</span><br /><br />You make your thank-yous, but are drowned out by the renewed discussion- your request seems to have touched on a pre-existing debate. Leaving word of where you can be found, you return to your mother&#039;s apartment. You take advantage of your solitude to craft that Mana Potion for Luki, a process that isn&#039;t terribly interesting but certainly passes the time. You do a little cleaning, eat a light lunch, listen to the rain and generally wait for time to pass until one of the Rangers who was on guard knocks on the door, and escorts you back to the Shrine.<br /><br />The various huddles of Elders seem to be quieter than before, although urgent discussion continues within some groups. They quiet as you once more approach the Eldest. He clears his throat as you approach, and launches straight into it.<br /><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">It is the decision of this council that you remain within the Vale.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">...May I ask why? I did give several good reasons, and I think you owe me the justification.</span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">Simply put, you gave excellent reasons for an Elven presence in the world, but you cannot honestly make the case that you are the most qualified to <em>be</em> that presence. We have trained diplomats who can represent our interests, and we have qualified scouts who can provide us with information and know how to blend into human lands. You are unsuited for either task, although your earnestness does you credit.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">So only the most skilled may leave? Is that how it was when other Necromancers threatened the land- send a token representative and be done with it?</span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">The case has been made that a greater general presence could do some good, but ultimately we have decided that it is in the best interests of Yicelafo for as many Elves as possible to remain within the protection of the Vale. Most Elves within the Vale know nothing of war or combat, yourself included. We will shortly be announcing a new policy of conscription- if any Necromancer comes against us, they will have to fight through the combined might of the Elvish nation. Once the security of the Vale is assured, we plan to allow volunteer expeditionary forces to venture forth against the Necromancers.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">And what will it take to assure the safety of the Vale?</span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">We hope to see the common elf become proficient in the martial arts, especially as regards combating the undead. The Mages are even now dusting off magics not seen since the last Necromancer walked the earth. We will secure the borders through both magic and vigilance, and we will monitor the situation on the world stage to keep from being outmaneuvered. With luck, this can be accomplished in as little as two years- surely not longer.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I see. I suppose that&#039;s... certainly the safe route to take.</span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">The safety of our people is paramount. Enjoy the Fair, Nym- when it is over, the work will begin.</span><br /><br />The Eldest makes a kindly- but clearly dismissive- gesture, and steps down from his boulder. The Elders, satisfied at the judgement handed down, return to their discussions. You hadn&#039;t expected much better, but it is still disheartening to hear the rejection. Two years until they think the average elf will be skilled enough to survive outside the Vale? To most elves, that is a brief time, but you are young, and have a secret- it seems an eternity.<br /><br />The more you think on it, the grimmer the future looks. Two years until broader action against the Necromancers- that means that in two years, the Elders expect there will still be Necromancers to fight. At the rate they are going thus far, Thrimesdur will be an Empire of the Undead by then, with the Jeweled Coast suborned or conquered- a gloomy thought, to be sure.<br /><br />As you leave, you are stopped by none other than Pevo Zephyrtempest!<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Pevo? What are you doing here? You aren&#039;t one of the Elders!</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Neither are you, but here we are! Actually, I was called in to give testimony on the outside world- I am the only trained Sage to have left the Vale, which gives me something of a unique perspective.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Well, I&#039;m sure you heard their verdict.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">I have, which is why I wanted to speak with you. I thought you should know, your words did more good than you suspect.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">What?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Before you spoke, the Elders were ready to just seal the Vale and be done with it. You demonstrated that the average elf cares about what goes on out in the world, and you raised good points in favor of involvement in the world.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Yeah, but surely I wasn&#039;t the first to think of them.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">No, nor were you the first to say them- but you were the first to say them in such a firm and public manner. It really crystallized support that had been undirected before. With some practice and tutoring, you could be a great orator, I think.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Now you&#039;re just flattering me.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Maybe, but it&#039;s deserved. Regardless of how or why, you made a difference here- now there&#039;s talk of sending a delegation to the Prince of the West about coordinating the efforts of Yicelafo and Thrimesdur, and I expect the Elders will be more receptive to ideas about sending military advisers and the like to help.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Well, that sounds like a good thing, although I think you&#039;re giving me too much credit. I suppose I&#039;ll go enjoy the Fair while I can.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Take care, Nym, wherever you go.</span><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2936098#msg2936098">Quote from: GlyphGryph on Fri 27-01-2012, 18:49:32</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As far as mooching goes - that&#039;s part of why I want to see the council.

The festival atmosphere is rather muted, dampened by the rain and the rumors of war and conscription. You spend a little time sight seeing with an eye open for Elana, but don&#039;t see her. Eventually, you make your way to Luki Revereorder&#039;s tent, trading your Mana Potion for the promised 36 silver and the supplies for tomorrows potion. You briefly debate visiting Omo, but decide to just head home already.<br /><br />When you arrive home, you find your Mother has preceded you. It doesn&#039;t take much acting to look rather glum, and after helping prepare a meal you sit down to eat together.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">Alright, so what&#039;s up with you?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Well, I asked the Elders permission to leave the Vale today- I was refused.</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">And a good thing, too- it&#039;s too dangerous out there for any sane elf.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Yeah, yeah. I&#039;m still pretty bummed out about it, though.</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">Well, if you ever need anything, you know you can talk to me about it.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Thanks. ...Actually, now that you mention it, there&#039;s this amulet that caught my eye at the Fair.</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">Oh is there? What&#039;s so special about it?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">The merchant thinks that it&#039;s an old dwarven artifact or a similar relic- I think he&#039;s crazy if he thinks it&#039;s dwarven, but it does have a certain something about it. Unfortunately, since he&#039;s convinced it is so valuable I wasn&#039;t able to argue down his price at all.</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">How much is he asking?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">100 gold, at minimum.</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">Whew... you&#039;ve got expensive taste, you know that?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Well, I worked out a way to make almost 20 gold selling potions, but that isn&#039;t nearly enough, especially since I&#039;d have to get it to him before he left with the Caravan. I was thinking, maybe if I could get a small loan...</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">A small 80 gold loan?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Not all <em>that </em>much, maybe more like 30 more- I could totally argue him down a bit.</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">Nice try- I doubt you can argue him down 50% of his asking price, and even if you could I&#039;m not going to float you 30 gold for a trinket. The most rewarding things in life are the things you earn yourself.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Maybe, but this is literally a once in a lifetime opportunity- the odds I&#039;ll ever see this particular piece of jewelry again are staggeringly unlikely.</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">There&#039;s always other pieces of jewelry, and we <em>are </em>immortal. Good things come to those who wait. Although, if you&#039;re convinced that it isn&#039;t an artifact, I could come test it for you- that might get him to drop the price.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">What? You can do that?</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">There are ways, yes. A true Artifact is... well, it&#039;s almost alive, but it is a very peculiar form of life. Life magics can&#039;t affect it, but I know techniques that can detect it.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">That&#039;s... I did not know that. It certainly bears thinking about. Something that is alive that normally isn&#039;t... it sounds like Necromancy to me.</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">It&#039;s similar, we think, but not true Necromancy. Dwarves are known to be innately able to make Artifacts under special conditions- we don&#039;t know much about it, but it isn&#039;t Necromancy. We know that Mages of all faiths could make Artifacts in ancient times, so it isn&#039;t just a dwarf thing, either. And it isn&#039;t Vitality that is inside an Artifact- it&#039;s something rather more complicated, you&#039;d have to be a Mage to understand.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Are you sure it isn&#039;t Necromancy? Can you detect that?</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">Yes, I&#039;m sure. We do have spells to detect Necromantic energy- the artifacts the Elders guard do not register anything like that. Maybe if we could deduce how exactly Artifacts work, we&#039;d be able to create them once more.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Well! That&#039;s certainly interesting. In other news, you&#039;ve heard that the Elders plan on enforcing conscription?</span><br /><br />You redirect the conversation to the news you already know- your Mother had only heard rumors, whereas you had been there in person. Although you continue to make small talk, you are really thinking about this new information. Life Mages can detect Necromantic energy, and Artifacts are arguably alive, huh? Can your Necromancy affect the amulet where Life magic cannot? If somebody can prove it&#039;s an Artifact, it seems that Luki will indeed make a nice profit on it if he reaches the Jeweled Coast. If somebody can prove it&#039;s a <em>Necromantic </em>Artifact... well, who knows what would happen to it.<br /><br />After talking for some time, you head to bed early, and enjoy a pleasant, dreamless sleep. The question is, what will you do tomorrow?<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 10/10<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 0/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 19/20<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">38.7 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Belt Knife, Leather Backpack (Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, Potion Making Supplies)<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Fine<br /><strong>Nine</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - you can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Necromancy</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Raise Zombie</strong></span></span></span>- ?

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- Test Command Undead by commanding something you&#039;ve raised to self-terminate.&nbsp; &nbsp;A further test of this would be if it could work on the undead that other necromancers have summoned.<br />- Test Command Undead, and see if can you over-ride commands given to a zombie summoned by another necromancer.&nbsp; Does the zombie respond to the most recent order given, or does it have loyalty to whomever summoned it?&nbsp; Or maybe it is under the control of the more powerful of the two necromancers.<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Yicelafo<br /><a href="http://img.ie/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/6.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

After your habitual ablutions, you once again join your Mother in the kitchen for an early meal.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Hey, Mom. I&#039;ve been thinking, and I&#039;d like to take you up on that offer to test the merchant&#039;s medallion.</span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">Alright- if you&#039;d like to go now, we could do it before I go to work for the day.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Actually, I was hoping we could be discreet about it, just in case it <em>is</em> an Artifact.

Well, if you want to go now, let&#039;s go.</span><br /><br />After tidying up, you escort your mother back across the bridge to the Caravan Fair. Though still rather chilly and dark, it isn&#039;t raining at the moment. You enter Luki Revereorder&#039;s tent- once again, the early hour means that the tent is empty save for the merchant himself.<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Hello, Nym! Finished with that potion already? And who is this pretty girl with you?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Good morning, master Revereorder. You said you were taking that medallion to the coast to be appraised, right? Well, this is my mother, and I think she can provide a fair estimation of its worth.</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>Oh? Is she a historian?</strong></span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">Greetings, master Revereorder- I am a Mage of Yicelafo. I can&#039;t tell you its value as a historical item, but I can eliminate the possibility of it being an artifact for you. Now, where is this medallion?</span></strong><br /><br />Luki blinks, then hesitantly takes the medallion off the peg and holds it up for your mother&#039;s inspection. She matter-of-factly reaches out and snatches the item, ignoring Luki&#039;s slight wince. You are as attracted as ever to its beckoning necromantic energy, and watch with keen interest as your mother inspects the fine etching of the ravens. <br /><br />She holds the medallion in the palm of her left hand, and her right hand begins to trace a circle above it. Luki gasps as a faint green light seems to settle down from your mother&#039;s hand, floating above the medallion. As her hand moves, the light ripples with it, much like a hand will ripple a bucket of water. She hums softly to herself as she works her magic, concentrating intently.<br /><br />Suddenly, you notice the purple glow of the medallion... shift. At first you think your eyes tricked you, but soon it happens again, then again- the glow seems to pulse now, in time with the green light. With each pulse, you see the purple glow reach a little higher, and the green light sink lower. Finally, the energies meet, and your mother dismisses the spell with a surprised look on her face.<br /><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">Well! It seems you were right, master Revereorder- this is indeed an artifact.</span></strong><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>Really?!? You&#039;re sure? What does it do?</strong></span><br /><strong><span style="color: limegreen;" class="bbc_color">I cannot say without extensive testing.

Reaffirm that we have every intent of leaving with him before the fair ends, and ask him if he knows where we can find Elana - and if she might have any knowledge on how to communicate effectively over a distance. We&#039;re going to take a risk here, of course - if it falls through, we won&#039;t mention Omo. He should be able to get out without us if he still wants to leave.

Your path takes you deeper into Yicelafo, past the Great Temple and Shrine into the heart of the residential district. The treehouses are stacked thickly here, to the point that they touch the ground, making the tree appear to be a single large apartment with a living canopy for a roof. It is in one of these residential blocks that you find the right home, tucked on ground level astride a massive root.<br /><br />Elana herself answers the door, and for a moment it&#039;s like you are seeing her again for the first time. Her carefully braided hair is strawberry-blonde, a rarity among the elves. Almond eyes in a fair face regard you with surprise. Simple, warm clothing adds little breadth to her slight frame- she almost seems to be an adult in a child&#039;s body, and though you are no giant you stand nearly a full head taller.<br /><br />Elana seems to hesitate a moment before inviting you in. You greet her friend, an older woman you know only through your association with Elana. After exchanging pleasantries and being a generally good hostess, she seems to catch the mood in the air and decides this would be an opportune time to go grocery shopping. The room is silent for a long moment after the door closes behind her.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF00FF;" class="bbc_color">...well- I didn&#039;t expect to see you here, after your last letter, Nym.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Yeah, well... you heard about the Necromancers, I trust.</span><br /><span style="color: #FF00FF;" class="bbc_color">I did. I&#039;m sorry your trip was canceled, but really, it&#039;s probably for the best.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">About that- I plan on leaving anyway.</span><br /><span style="color: #FF00FF;" class="bbc_color">What! What could possibly be possessing you to hare off into a warzone!?!</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Well, it seems to me that I can do more good learning more about our ancestral homeland and how it was destroyed than cooped up here at home. Maybe there&#039;s a clue that can keep it from happening again.</span><br /><span style="color: #FF00FF;" class="bbc_color">That&#039;s crazy! You&#039;d have to be a Mage to find out anything, and that&#039;s if there was anything more to find out! The Sacred Grove is a waste, and you&#039;re wasting your time if you go out there!</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Oh come on, to hear you talk taking one step outside of Yicelafo is a death sentence. Weren&#039;t you always trying to get me to do something with my life?</span><br /><span style="color: #FF00FF;" class="bbc_color">I meant use your life to get a good job, help out society, not throw it away because you&#039;ve got itchy feet!</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I am going to help out society, better than I could if I were just going to hold a spear the day the Necromancer&#039;s armies come knocking at the door!</span><br /><br />You are both quiet for a moment.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF00FF;" class="bbc_color">...oh, be careful, you stubborn fool. Just be careful.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Aren&#039;t I always? Besides, it can&#039;t be as bad as all that out there. Heck, the last place the Necromancer is likely to be is in the middle of an uninhabited wasteland! There aren&#039;t even any bodies there for him to... utilize.</span><br /><span style="color: #FF00FF;" class="bbc_color">I&#039;d have said desecrate, but I take your meaning.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Do you know anybody else who wanted to leave the Vale? Maybe somebody who would be willing to help me?</span><br /><span style="color: #FF00FF;" class="bbc_color">Ha! You&#039;re the only one I know foolish enough to leave the Vale in the middle of a war.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Hey, technically, we aren&#039;t at war yet.</span><br /><span style="color: #FF00FF;" class="bbc_color">Yeah, now tell me another.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Alright, how about this- do you know of any way to magically communicate across distances?</span><br /><span style="color: #FF00FF;" class="bbc_color">Myself? No, but I know it is possible. I know I&#039;ve seen the Life Mages use animal messengers, but I&#039;m pretty sure there&#039;s a general magic spell that lets you send messages across distances.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Do you know anyone who could teach me? It&#039;d be terribly helpful.</span><br /><span style="color: #FF00FF;" class="bbc_color">I imagine one of the Life Mages could teach you, but from what I gather it is somewhat difficult and involved- that&#039;s why they normally just send animal messengers.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">How does that work, anyway? Can they control the animals?</span><br /><span style="color: #FF00FF;" class="bbc_color">No, but it isn&#039;t that hard to communicate with them using Life magic, after a fashion, and animals are pretty easy to bribe. Ha, not the most reliable though- one time, a Mage sent a sparrow with a message to summon me for a lesson, but I never got it. He found the bird holed up in his nest with his lady love- apparently some more immediate concerns came up en route.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Ha! That&#039;s rich. Well, I won&#039;t take up any more of your time- take care of yourself, if I don&#039;t see you again before I leave.</span><br /><br />You stand to make your goodbyes, and impulsively give Elana a big bear hug. She stiffens in surprise for a moment before hugging you back fiercely. After a long moment, you separate, and exit the apartment.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2968776#msg2968776">Quote from: Felius on Thu 09-02-2012, 02:52:58</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">That said, ask Pevo more about necromancy, now that we have two known necromancers active.

Is there a commonly accepted reason for why there haven&#039;t been more than one necromancer active at the same time? Pass this as you planning to be a sage. In fact, actually try to become a sage. Focus on necromancy so much because after all, you want to know more about the enemy that is plaguing this land. You are not a powerful mage. You are not a strong warrior. But you can collaborate by knowing about them and advising how to proceed. After Pevo, start hitting the books, ask access to all libraries you canm search for any ruins in elven lands that might contain a hint, etc. If you are discreet enough try to search the libraries and such with necro vision, specially if they are very old and lacking a index system. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg2969011#msg2969011">Quote from: The Alchemist on Thu 09-02-2012, 04:35:58</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Going off of what Felius said about becoming a sage, while I don&#039;t think it will work out to well I do think that we should try learning as much as we can about the basic properties of magic, just purely the theory not practice for right now if we&#039;re going to stay for training then we can learn the practice of it. Also if we stay we can also learn some more general magic spells that might help us out later and help us understand the basics of necromancy if all magic contain some of the same basic rules. If we are still staying then lets find ourselves a place for experiments again, if not then ignore the majority of this.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Since it&#039;s on your way back anyway, you decide to drop in on the Great Temple and pay Pevo a visit. You find him in his quarters, apparently reading a book.<br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Nym! Good to see you.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Hello Pevo- do you have a moment to answer a couple random questions?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Certainly, though I doubt they are anything but random.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Heh- true enough. Well, considering the sudden surplus of Necromancers, I thought it&#039;d pay to know a bit more about them. Has there ever been more than one active at a time before now?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">No, there has not, not since the Golgothan War. The Golgothans were wiped out in the aftermath of that war, and for a time it was thought that the threat of Necromancy was done forever. However, much like how Life Mages will sometimes arise among the humans, sometimes Necromancers arise among them as well. It is not often the spark breeds true, but every century or two another Necromancer arises to wreak havoc on the world.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Why is that? Why do they always try to conquer the world, I mean?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Who knows? Some say Necromancy is inherently evil, but I don&#039;t think so. The Golgothans got along more or less peacefully with the other races before Balkoth came to power, from what I can glean of our remaining texts and what I found during my sabbatical in Thrimesdur. Some think that it is just because humans are easily corruptible, and Necromancy offers a unique, direct sort of power nobody else can control or understand. Some blame the meddling of gods or other forces. No Necromancer has ever consented to an interview, so we can&#039;t know for sure</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Could it be that some Necromancers never managed to control their powers, or even manifest them without guidance?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">It could be, and in fact is rather likely. Of the Elves we teach here in Yicelafo, many would not have utilized their power without outside guidance to start them on the path. That is one reason we test so thoroughly- if we didn&#039;t, we&#039;d have far fewer Mages. It is a comparatively small percentage of magic-users who manifest their abilities unconsciously, without any outside interference.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I see. Is that true for general magic users as well?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">No, not at all. General magic is a much more deliberate, controlled usage of Mana than the others- that&#039;s why the other Magical Faiths can achieve such greater feats. Anyone with a Mana pool can learn to use general magic spells, but nobody will just start spontaneously casting them.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I&#039;m not sure I quite understand the distinction.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Think of it like this; the Magical Faiths are like the different ways animals can move through the woods. Wolves can run on all fours faster than we can, and birds can fly over obstacles, and fish can swim places we cannot. They are all different from one another, and none of them are really conscious decisions to <em>be </em>different, but they are all more effective than just trying to walk through the underbrush.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">...I think I&#039;ve got it, though it still isn&#039;t quite clear.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Well, it isn&#039;t a perfect metaphor- maybe a Mage could explain it better.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">So is there any special reason there&#039;s never been more than one Necromancer at a time?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">No, no special reason. It is just staggeringly unlikely. The fact we have 2 at once is likely just statistics catching up with us, to our misfortune. It&#039;d take more than that for me to suspect something more, the way some folks have been whispering.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Whispering?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">You know, the usual nonsense. &quot;The End is Nigh, Darkness will cover the land, evil gods will awaken, fire and brimstone.&quot; All poppycock- we face a challenge unlike any since the Golgothan War, yes, but no need to go dragging in prophecies and ancient evils over it. We are quite capable of having a statistical improbability without anyone else having a hand in it.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Yes... of course. Well, I think that satisfies my curiosity for now. Thank you for your time, Pevo Zephyrtempest.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Any time, Nym, any time.</span><br /><br />You leave the Great Temple and head back home as the afternoon grows late. You make another potion for Luki with the daylight you have left, resolving to deliver it the following morning.

Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments.

Apart from practical considerations like the profit potential of your arrangement with Luki or the last few things you want to do, there is also the knowledge that once you leave, you will not be back in Yicelafo for a long time, perhaps years or even decades. As well, you know that once you leave, you&#039;ll have to tell Omo what you are. You risk his friendship and perhaps your life, but you can&#039;t lie to your old friend- he deserves to know the truth about his traveling companion. It must be done, but you doubt it will be pleasant, and anything that delays that day is welcome in your book.<br /><br />Despite Omo&#039;s growing impatience, you take this opportunity to enjoy the sights and sounds of the Young Vale and your fellow elves. You spend your time dancing, singing, talking, and generally enjoying yourself, basking in the festival atmosphere. Some days are wet, others are dry, but there is always a fire to gather &#039;round and merry making to be had.<br /><br />Which is not to say you don&#039;t also accomplish some other minor tasks.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3054798#msg3054798">Quote from: RAM on Fri 02-03-2012, 05:35:28</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Exactly, no more elves, so it may be that we can easily acquire a beginner&#039;s guide to general magic here that would be the equivalent of a rare and powerful compendium of lost arts across most of the rest of the world.

I don&#039;t know what sort of books would be appropriate, probably something portable with a large selection of utility spells, such as communication, protection from hostile environments, mobility enhancement. Something with enough information that someone could figure out how to use the described effects with study and practice, while being sufficiently brief that it could be carried without being too much of an impediment. Perhaps one very detailed instruction on a single magical effect and another with basic details on performing most of the effects that would be useful on a journey to a magically unusual environment.<br />&nbsp;A list of available works that describe the process of evoking general magic would be useful, our budget would probably preclude anything over, say, 10 gold, maybe look into items up to 20 gold if they are particularly desirable...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3035864#msg3035864">Quote from: GlyphGryph on Sun 26-02-2012, 08:47:35</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Oh, and I should add - talk to merchant, tell him you&#039;re glad you could help him turn such a tidy profit on the artifact.

Why, with that profit added to my margins I rather think I could fund a caravan of my own!</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I&#039;m glad to hear it. Say, you know the merchant selling Crystal, right? I&#039;d like to get in touch with him to buy a little stash of my own.</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">I know him, I know him indeed, but I fear he has little to offer you. The same elf who bought my artifact for Yicelafo also snapped up his entire inventory.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Oh, no.</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Oh yes, it appears you elves are stockpiling the stuff for the coming war. But, tell you what- as a thank you for bringing my artifact to the attention of the Mages, I&#039;ll sell you some of the Crystal I bought off of him- no markup, just 20 silver per ounce.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Really? That&#039;s kind of you. How much do you have?</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">I can part with five ounces, which would be enough for five Mana were you to use it in a potion. 100 silver- Interested?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Sold! As long as I&#039;m here, do you have any spellbooks in your inventory?</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">I do not, but I believe there is a bookseller in the Caravan- he regularly makes the journey back and forth between Thrimesdur and the Jeweled Coast.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Thank you Luki- see you tomorrow.</span><br /><br />It doesn&#039;t take you long to find the bookseller- his wagon is rather large, but he has little inventory out for display. Most elves care not for extensive reading, but there are a few customers in his tent examining ornate quills, a variety of inks, solvents, and other curious objects associated with the art of manuscript. The bookseller himself is a tall, thin reed of a man, with knobby knees and elbows, wisps of grey hair escaping from under his stained Rope Reed Fiber cap.<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Good day, and how may I help you today?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Hello, I was wondering if you had any books about magic.</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Hoo hoo! You&#039;ll have to be more specific than that, dearie, for I&#039;ve many a tome on the subject.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Oh really? I was hoping for something on the performance of general magic, or perhaps the theory behind it.</span><br />The merchant pulls out a binder, and begins quickly scanning through the pages. <strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Hm... ah, I possess a copy of <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust- it was first written shortly after the Golgothan War ended. An interesting story there- you see, after the Golgothan War, there were many villages who lacked a local Priest or Wizard to perform magic, since so many died in the war itself. Meadtrust was an instructor at the Wizarding Academy who was frustrated by the brief time he had to teach new Wizards and Priests their art before they had to return. He wrote this book in an attempt to alleviate the problem- he would teach them the basics of magic, and they could then take guidance from his tome to learn the rest on their own. Was a miserable failure, you know, most of his students were stymied by the overly technical language of the text, but once the rate of admissions and graduations returned to a normal level it became quite popular as a reference text for the more isolated practitioners away from the cities. Joddo didn&#039;t live to see it, though, died thinking the attempt was his greatest failure, and on one notable occasion he sought to burn any copy he could get his hands on to rid himself of the embarrassment.</span></strong><br />Your eyes glaze over somewhat at the rapid-fire onslaught of information, and as the merchant gathers his breath you hurriedly interject, <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Sounds perfect! How much are you asking?</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">I have a couple copies, as it happens- one is a relatively new and more inexpensive edition, but if you&#039;re a collector I have the most lovely illuminated copy written shortly after Meadtrust&#039;s death, made by a monk at-</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">The less expensive one will be fine- how much?</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Ah, for the obvious utility of its contents and important cultural context, I couldn&#039;t part with it for less than 32 silver and 5 copper pieces. There-</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">That will do just fine, thank you.</span><br /><br />The merchant blinks, then excuses himself and retreats to his wagon. After a few long moments he returns, bearing a leather bound book somewhat larger than you had anticipated. Completing your transaction, you step outside and inspect your new purchase. The text within is written in a tight, clean script- there are intermittent illustrations and diagrams demonstrating one concept or another. Paging to the very back, you find an index, and examine the contents. There are a variety of minor divinations (Detect Vitality and the like,) as well as a handful of simple illusions, a brief description of the other Magical Faiths, some utility spells that seem useful... ooh, Message! <br /><br />Flipping through to that entry, you find that spell is a way to send a message one way, at a distance. Disappointingly, cursory examination seems to suggest that the range is rather limited- a few miles at best. You blanch as you read more of the instructions- the merchant was not exaggerating about the overly technical language! It doesn&#039;t seem to be anything you can&#039;t figure out, but it will likely take some time and concentrated effort to learn any spells from this book. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3066467#msg3066467">Quote from: Cellmonk on Tue 06-03-2012, 02:17:52</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3066380#msg3066380">Quote from: adwarf on Tue 06-03-2012, 01:49:28</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I think we should head to the Dwarves, spending no longer then a day in any city besides theirs, they have the highest chance to accept us for what we are, and I have a feeling they may be able to help us in making golems, and may even have records of old necromancers who were <em>good</em> like us.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />To the dwarves! aye, that should be our long term goal.

Either way, we should <strong>ask pevo about the dwarves.</strong><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Another day, you find yourself thinking about the dwarves- perhaps their reputedly cunning craftsmanship could create an object more readily suited for transformation into a golem. Now that you think about it, didn&#039;t Pevo say something peculiar about dwarf/Necromancer relations? You resolve to ask him, and return to his room in the Great Temple for expressly that purpose.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Afternoon, Pevo, how are you?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">I&#039;m quite well, Nym- here with some more questions?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">You know me too well, Pevo. Actually, I was wondering what you knew of the Dwarves- did you visit their lands in your travels?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">I did not, nor do I have any inclination to do so- that people has a poor reputation.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Why is that?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">It isn&#039;t easy to pin down- the Elves have had little contact with the Dwarves since the Golgothan War, and the history of our racial relations is one of the many things lost in that conflict. From what I can gather, the Dwarves of the Earth Kingdom were solid allies of the Golgothans prior to the war, as well as the Fire Nation. When the war started, the dwarves did not condone Balkoth&#039;s aggression and did not join his assault on Elven lands, but neither did they hinder him. Supposedly, when they heard of the near genocide of the Elvish people, they annulled their alliance immediately, but I know for a fact they did not join in the war against Balkoth until he betrayed and exterminated the Fire Giants.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Well, that doesn&#039;t sound too bad- they were faithful to an ally, and turned when his evil became clear.</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Very reasonable of you, but it is difficult to get past the fact that, if they had stood against Balkoth from the outset, the Sacred Grove might yet stand.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">That&#039;s the history, but who are the dwarves as a people?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Again, this is secondhand information, but the dwarves are reputed to be a hardy folk with great mineral wealth, and the finest craftsmen in the world. They are also an ancient people- they lack the stability and continuous line of Emperors that Thrimesdur has enjoyed, but their mountain halls and fortresses are older than the Empire itself. Other than that, I only know stereotypes- they drink, they are expert craftsmen, big beards, few manner, the usual.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Their fortresses are older than the Empire? Could it be they possess ancient knowledge of ages past, even greater than the libraries of Thrimesdur might contain?</span><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">It is possible, I suppose, though I doubt it is as well organized as the Cremated Empire&#039;s archives. The dwarves supposedly have a rather guarded nature, making it difficult for human chroniclers to get the full story out of them- there could well be hidden histories and engravings deep in the oldest mountain homes, unknown to the outside world and perhaps even to the dwarves themselves.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I see. Thank you Pevo, that was quite enlightening.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />All too soon, the morning of your departure arrives. You make and deliver Luki&#039;s final potion early in the morning, and well before midday you join up with Omo, leaving Yicelafo towards the East and Thrimesdur. You are the only ones leaving Yicelafo before the final ceremonies and the grand sending-off of the Caravan, and the road is clear. Omo whistles a jaunty tune, pleased to finally be leaving, and you can&#039;t help but succumb to his infectious happiness. The time passes quickly as you sing traveling songs and enjoy the unseasonably warm weather.<br /><br />After the first day of travel, you make camp not far from the river. Once you finish eating a hearty meal, you briefly confer with Omo about your route, examining the map Pevo gave you days ago.<br /><br /><a href="http://img.ie/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/6.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /><br />By his estimation, you&#039;ve passed beyond the limits of Elven habitation on the northern shore- by the end of the day tomorrow, you&#039;ll be well away from any Elvish settlements of any kind. After that, Omo informs you, it is little more than a hard day&#039;s march to the river crossing of Larathor, a large human settlement on the Great River and your first step beyond the confines of the Vale. Omo cautions that Ranger patrols will likely be thick along the river, and you&#039;ll have a much higher risk of meeting them throughout that last day. Hopefully, Omo&#039;s knowledge of the patrol routes will guide you safely through.<br /><br />As you fall asleep, you can&#039;t help but worry- when should you reveal yourself to Omo? Tomorrow night, when you will be in the midst of the forest? The night after, when you have dodged the Elvish patrols, crossed the river and reached Larathor? Later, somewhere in the wilderness of Thrimesdur?<br /><br />You try to put such concerns aside and go to sleep- the next few days promise to be tiring.<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 10/10<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 0/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 19/20<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">86.2 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Belt Knife, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Fine<br /><strong>Fifteen</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - you can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Necromancy</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Raise Zombie</strong></span></span></span>- ?

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- Test Command Undead by commanding something you&#039;ve raised to self-terminate.&nbsp; &nbsp;A further test of this would be if it could work on the undead that other necromancers have summoned.<br />- Test Command Undead, and see if can you over-ride commands given to a zombie summoned by another necromancer.&nbsp; Does the zombie respond to the most recent order given, or does it have loyalty to whomever summoned it?&nbsp; Or maybe it is under the control of the more powerful of the two necromancers.<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recomend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Yicelafo<br /><a href="http://img.ie/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/6.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

Our first day in the wilderness - may it come quickly.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />When you awaken the next morning, you resolve to wait until you are in the wilderness of Human lands to tell Omo- surely no more than a few days from now. Crawling out of the tent, you find that Omo has snared a pair of rabbits, and tuck in to an enjoyable meal.<br /><br />Your second day out from Yicelafo starts foggy, but warm. Spring is in full swing, and summer is on its way. You and Omo speak only a little, the fog muffling your quiet conversation, and soon you lapse into an amiable silence as you enjoy the serene quality of your journey. The fog burns off as the afternoon wears on, helped along by a cool breeze along the riverbank. As you travel, Omo grows more and more perturbed, sometimes stopping and peering at the trees uneasily. After the third such pause, you turn to him quizzically.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Omo, what do you think you&#039;re doing?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">I&#039;ve been seeing a lot of trailsign in the trees.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Trailsign?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Yeah, it&#039;s a Ranger thing. Little ways to communicate with other Rangers. Like, you see that flower and leaf tied to the branch with a vine?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">How do you know that&#039;s a flower? Looks like a stem to me.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Yeah, it&#039;s a rose stem actually. Wouldn&#039;t do to leave the petals on the stem, you&#039;d see it from a mile off.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">If it&#039;s communication, isn&#039;t it supposed to be seen?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Yeah, but not by civilians, or enemies. It&#039;s kindof a Ranger secret. Anyway, my point is that I&#039;ve been seeing a lot of it. A lot more than I&#039;d expect to see.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">So... what? I&#039;m guessing this is a bad thing, from your tone.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Well, and I&#039;m not sure, which is why I didn&#039;t mention it yet, but I <em>think </em>that there&#039;s a big Ranger presence on the border. The things I&#039;ve been seeing seem to be patrols communicating with one another- normally I&#039;d expect there to be one patrol on duty at a time, and with the Necromancers I was expecting there to be two or three, but I think the trailsign I&#039;ve been seeing is between at least three different groups.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Didn&#039;t you just say you were expecting three?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Yeah, but we&#039;re not even at the edge of the forest yet. If there&#039;s this many patrols here, near the heart, how many are going to be out on the actual border? Are you sure the Elders weren&#039;t sealing the border yet?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I thought so. Maybe they decided to get a jump on the end of the Fair.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">I hope not. This could get tricky.</span><br /><br />Omo sets off, and you follow, somewhat troubled. You&#039;d rather hoped to avoid any run-ins with the Rangers- you doubt they&#039;ll track you down once you&#039;re gone, but they&#039;ll probably try to stop you before you get clear of the Vale. That night, Omo insists on a small fire and a campsite away from the river, and you don&#039;t feel inclined to disagree. After inconspicuously Sensing Vitality to take the edge off your mana pool, you go to sleep.<br /><br />You arise early the next morning and head out, digging into your trail rations for breakfast on the go- with luck, you&#039;ll be in Thrimesdur by sundown. Omo is visibly tense, and every few hours points out another piece of trailsign- a warning about a bear den here, a guide to delicious honeycomb there, and apparently a heap of Ranger humor everywhere judging by Omo&#039;s snorts and dismissive gestures.<br /><br />You make good time traveling along the riverbank as the Great River curves to the south. As the afternoon wears on, Omo starts stopping more frequently, holding up a hand for silence. Eventually, he calls for a halt altogether, and leads you to a secluded little clump of shrubs. You are more than happy for the rest break, for while you are no stranger to long walks you normally recover from your exertions in your comfy bed, not the cold bumpy ground. As you lean against a tree and dig into your provisions, Omo informs you that he&#039;s going scouting and slips away through the trees.<br /><br />You finish your meal, and stretch, waiting for Omo to return. The minutes seem to drag by, alone in the woods- it feels like hours, but by the sun it is only about 30 minutes later that Omo comes back, a grim look on his face.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">We&#039;ve got a problem Nym. There&#039;s a lot of Rangers here, and I&#039;m not sure we can slip past them.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">What? How many is a lot?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Enough to repulse an attack from the river, and more than enough to catch us if we aren&#039;t careful. It looks like this is a local staging point for the Rangers, protecting the ferry at Larathor.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">The ferry?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Yeah- it&#039;s how the Caravan crossed, and how I was planning to get to Thrimesdur. From what I can tell, there&#039;s a picket watching the ferry at all times, and lots of Rangers in the treeline up and down the Great River.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">You saw all that? Are you sure you weren&#039;t spotted?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">I&#039;m sure- they were too busy looking out to keep more than a cursory eye on the Walled Jungle behind them. The real question is, what do we do now.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">What are our options?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Well, we could try to make it to the ferry. We&#039;d almost certainly be spotted, but if we can get across the guiderope before the sentries catch up we should be alright. We could try it under the cover of darkness, which would be much more dangerous but might let us make it unseen.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Alright, so when you say &quot;get across the guiderope&quot;...</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">I mean that there&#039;s a rope that runs from one bank of the river to the other. The ferry almost certainly won&#039;t be on our side of the river, and we can&#039;t wait for it to come to us, so we&#039;ll have to do it the old fashioned way. Hand over hand.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Yeah, I&#039;m not feeling that plan. What else you got?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">My only other idea would be to go around- we could go north and try to find a spot we can swim across or ford, or we could go south and try to wave down a boat- if we go south far enough we&#039;ll hit another town sooner or later. Either option would take us days out of our way, and we&#039;d still have to worry about Ranger patrols while we&#039;re traveling.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Yeah, I&#039;m not crazy about that option either.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">I say we just make a run for it. You got a better idea?</span><br /><br />It&#039;s a tough situation- Omo seems confident in his ability to outrun the Rangers, but you are somewhat less sure. What should you do?<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 10/10<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 12/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 19/20<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">86.2 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Belt Knife, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Tired<br /><strong>Seventeen</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - you can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Necromancy</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Raise Zombie</strong></span></span></span>- ?

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- Test Command Undead by commanding something you&#039;ve raised to self-terminate.&nbsp; &nbsp;A further test of this would be if it could work on the undead that other necromancers have summoned.<br />- Test Command Undead, and see if can you over-ride commands given to a zombie summoned by another necromancer.&nbsp; Does the zombie respond to the most recent order given, or does it have loyalty to whomever summoned it?&nbsp; Or maybe it is under the control of the more powerful of the two necromancers.<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />- Steal Vitality on self<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recomend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Yicelafo<br /><a href="http://img.ie/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/6.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

It seems to be fairly easy to learn- a few hours of study, and you should have it figured out no later than noon tomorrow.<br /><br />The other spell is described as a way to make writing permanent, allowing it to survive any number of indignities. It looks a lot more complicated to learn, however, and the complexity means you can&#039;t really assess how versatile or potent it is. It could easily take you a couple of days to get working.<br /><br /><br />RE: Tiredness- while weary, you are not so tired that it will significantly affect your skill checks should the worst happen.<br /><br />RE: Bear- the bear was probably a solid hour&#039;s hike back up the trail- judicious application of honeycomb and Calm Animal should be enough to lure the bear to the Ranger camp, but you wouldn&#039;t get back until after dark, if that affects your plan.<br /><br /><br />With that information, go ahead and cast your votes, next update will be an update of ACTION!</div>

It&#039;s very cheap, very light (it&#039;s pretty much just a leather thong, and that&#039;s if I&#039;m being generous), has a long range (compared to the shortbow, at least), and uses things you can just pick up off the ground as ammunition (saving on arrows). The only drawback is whether our elf, or indeed elves in general, know how to use slings- I can&#039;t imagine slings being very easy to learn. Oh, sure, it can&#039;t be hard to fling a rock out of a pouch or whatever that thing is called, but can you aim it? But alas. The point is moot.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;re about as proficient with the sling as you are with a bow- the principle differences between the two are that bow/arrows are more expensive, but deal more damage, while the sling is basically free, but deals less damage. Pretty much any clothier/leatherworker can make a sling out of the scraps they have lying around, and it&#039;s a popular weapon across the world. Elves don&#039;t use them much, mostly because Elven children don&#039;t spend their time running around fields whipping stones at rabbits and birds.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3103565#msg3103565">Quote from: Deep Waters on Sun 18-03-2012, 04:44:31</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Two: Do we actually know if Rangers can use magic, at least well enough to communicate with animals? If I remember correctly, Elana didn&#039;t know the spell herself, and she&#039;s a dedicated Life Mage. (Assuming that it&#039;s a spell. Elana said that &quot;it isn&#039;t hard to communicate with [animals] using Life Magic, after a fashion.&quot; Whatever &quot;after a fashion&quot; means, it doesn&#039;t sound like she&#039;s talking about a spell, exactly. Perhaps it&#039;s more like our Necromantic Sight, except more verbally-oriented?) Admittedly, there&#039;s probably a big difference between a fully-realized Ranger and and a Mage just out of her novitiate, but there&#039;s nothing in Omo&#039;s profile that suggests he knows any magic at all, either, and he&#039;s a (former) member of one of the Ranger bands that are being a problem to us right now. He also can&#039;t create mana potions, which appears to be a common, if not ubiquitous ability amongst mages. I don&#039;t recall any explicit mention of Rangers knowing magic, at least beyond the general spells that probably every elf knows being the fluffy magical sparkle creatures of rainbows and unicorns they are. (Actually, unicorns were pretty beast. Vicious, feral creatures with three foot long horns that are apparently so strong that, according to one &quot;account&quot;, unicorns leap off cliffs in order to escape pursuers, then take the entire shock of the fall on their horns. But I digress.) Monk&#039;s comments lead me to suspect that Rangers do have magic, but he hasn&#039;t exactly confirmed it for sure. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Much like Humans, Elves tend to do things they are interested, and not do things they aren&#039;t. Elves with high magical potential and interest in the Arcane Arts tend to become Mages, Elves with good physical abilities and interest in Nature and defending the homeland become Rangers, so on and so forth. There isn&#039;t a specific set of Ranger Spells, but there&#039;s nothing preventing a Ranger who had the capacity for Life Magic but not the interest from picking up a spell or two related to his chosen field of work. Old Elves especially tend to be multidisciplinary, since they have technically forever to learn any skill or ability they want to.<br /><br />That said, most Non-Mages don&#039;t learn much beyond the few General Magic spells it takes for them to decide whether or not they like learning magic. Omo does know a couple spells, but you haven&#039;t asked him and he hasn&#039;t volunteered. You do know from long association that his Mana pool is rather small and underdeveloped, and it&#039;s rather unlikely he knows more than the couple spells you knew yourself way back in Turn One. Elana specifying that animal communication was a Life Magic spell makes it much less likely that any given Ranger knows it, since they&#039;d need the capacity for Life&nbsp; Magic. Calm Animal is a general spell.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3103565#msg3103565">Quote from: Deep Waters on Sun 18-03-2012, 04:44:31</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This isn&#039;t related to the whole Ranger thing at all, just a bit of thinking on my part. The actual discussion was a little while ago, but I notice that many people assume that corpses animated by necromancy still end up decaying. Did I miss a post by Monk somewhere that stated that explicitly? Because if I haven&#039;t, that means we&#039;re assuming that based on our prior knowledge of the undead. Seeing as Necromancy appears consist of infusing things with Mana in such a way as it becomes Vitality and also manipulating Vitality itself, I don&#039;t see why that should be. In fact, I&#039;m not entirely certain what the difference is between Necromancy and Life Magic, when put in those terms, but that&#039;s not my point. My point is: why should something that has been forcibly infused with Vitality, which apparently is the force that keeps us all alive in this universe, continue to decay? ...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />At this point, you lack first-hand information that says reanimated things decay. Pevo mentioned at one point that (paraphrase) &quot;the skeletal monstrosity can&#039;t date to the Golgothan War because no Necromancer can make something last that long.&quot; The things you&#039;ve raised yourself have been destroyed before you could see how/if they decay, how rapidly, if that affects their Vitality, so on and so forth.<br /><br />The distinction between Life Magic and Necromancy isn&#039;t very well explored at this point- it&#039;s been mentioned in passing a couple times I think, but the most straightforward was Pevo&#039;s intro to the World Map in Update 3.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Pevo</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yes, the Golgothans were worshipers of Death- whereas the Mages of Life have the power to enhance the Vitality, the Life-Force of living things, the Necromancers had the power to take that Vitality and give it to the Dead.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3103565#msg3103565">Quote from: Deep Waters on Sun 18-03-2012, 04:44:31</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What did Gorgothans look like?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Why what a strange thing, that I&#039;ve mentioned more about the extinct Fire Giants and Air Elves than I have about the Golgothans.

I really like writing settings and systems, but its only in the last year or so I&#039;ve been able to write things that I didn&#039;t hate after a few months worth of objectivity set in, and I&#039;m still not terribly satisfied with my characterization abilities. One of the reasons I&#039;m running this game is to practice my writing skills, and I&#039;m quite pleased that it is going so well. Hopefully it will remain interesting/believable as the plot progresses.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />While your writing skills aren&#039;t polished, I&#039;d rate them at an overall of Adept. (I&#039;d give you a categorical assessment, but this is running on way, way too long and you probably don&#039;t want my criticism anyway. <img src="./Necromancer/7.gif" alt="&#58;P" title="Tongue" class="smiley" />) My complaints number only two. One: the dialogue seems a bit awkward. It&#039;s like watching a movie that has an extremely original and wonderfully engaging plot, but has characters that are being played by inexperienced (not bad, merely inexperienced) actors. Nothing that significantly detracts from the story, so to speak, but it&#039;s noticeable. That kind of thing only comes with practice, though, which is what this is all about, right? <img src="./Necromancer/10.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /> In any case, the plot twists that come along as a result of your unique take on Necromancy, as well as the setting development in general, more than makes up for it. I especially like the way the exposition is more or less coming out naturally- even our necro-elf&#039;s whole lack of prior knowledge about everything we&#039;re being told can easily be attributed not only to a general cultural/racial insularity but also our character&#039;s own insularity, and what she does know is explained quickly, in a cut and dry style that, while not my usual fare, is rather refreshing, and fitting for something like this. My other complaint is more personal in nature: I simply can&#039;t seem to get a handle on Nym&#039;s personality. Seeing as her thoughts and decisions are pretty much based on the ruminations of an entire community, it&#039;s not surprising that she doesn&#039;t have a very clear or established personality, but it just bothers me. I&#039;ll have to see if I can at least drudge up a basic profile, if only to satisfy myself. (Based on the DF personality traits, of course. <img src="./Necromancer/7.gif" alt="&#58;P" title="Tongue" class="smiley" />)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Please, everyone feel free to comment on things you like/don&#039;t like/observe about my writing style. Like I said, I&#039;m partly doing this to practice those skills, but it doesn&#039;t work if I&#039;m practicing the wrong things!<br /><br />Yeah, dialogue is easily my worst suit, I think. I had initially classified that as a subset of characterization, but that&#039;s probably a bad way to go about thinking of it. Hopefully it&#039;ll get better, and if not hopefully you won&#039;t feel inclined to have Nym cut out her own tongue to cut down on it <img src="./Necromancer/7.gif" alt="&#58;P" title="Tongue" class="smiley" />&nbsp; I knew I didn&#039;t want to infodump with the setting info, because that&#039;s not terribly fun to read, cuts down on the fun of learning new things, and makes it harder to get into things. Making updates information-dense without being ungainly has been a priority of mine. Part of the difference in delivery between new and old information is to help highlight that very difference, since the players wouldn&#039;t know otherwise- the idea is that the important new information is important and new, and should be focused on, while the other stuff is just something you haven&#039;t had occasion to think about since you first learned it.<br /><br />As far as Nym having a poorly defined personality, that&#039;s largely because she had no personality to start the game. I had no idea whether you were going to immediately flee your home, or reveal yourself, or start murdering people and stealing their corpses, or what, and I wanted to leave that open-ended since at the very beginning I only wanted to explore the Necromancy system I&#039;d worked out. As you mentioned, part of it is also having her actions determined by a hundred different voices in her head- my personal plan is that as You develop a history, you&#039;ll also develop a character. Thus far, you&#039;ve been much more focused on learning about the outside world and your gift rather than yourself, which is perfectly natural and fine. Children ask a lot more questions about the world and people around them than they do about themselves, and you&#039;re in that same place for much the same reasons. I could ramble longer about that, but we should be coming up on a Chapter Break soon and I think I&#039;ll do a brief retrospective at that point to shed some insight on the meta-game.<br /><br /><br /><br />Anywho, yes, I know I&#039;m late, I was gunning for this update out like four days ago but the real world is a fickle greedy bitch. Such is life.</div>

This is something that we should do regardless of which plan we choose: Look through <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> for basic waterproofing spells that are safe to apply to the book and to our writing materials. It would seriously suck if we managed to get across the river only to discover that our one and only source of general magical knowledge was ruined by the water.<br />1. Go find that bear that the trailsign warned about before and use a combination of <strong>Calm Animal</strong> and knowledge of the location of delicious honeycomb also mention by the trailsign to wheedle the bear into serving as a distraction for us by screwing around in the ranger&#039;s tents.

And, do you have an idea of where most of the Rangers are stationed?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Probably keeping watch on the ferry. There will be patrols and sentries all along the riverbank, but I think we can evade them if their schedules aren&#039;t significantly altered from when I was a Ranger.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Alright, how about we travel north a ways and pitch camp for the night, then I&#039;ll spend tomorrow learning that spell, then we find a log and make a crossing at twilight?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Sounds good to me- let&#039;s move.</span><br /><br />Standing, you settle your things and head northward- Omo leads you on a slightly westward curve, attempting to avoid any errant Elven Rangers. Afternoon quickly gives way to evening, and then dusk. Urging stealth, Omo makes no fire, and instead of setting up the tent he fashions a crude lean-to from scattered branches. You settle down for a cold, uncomfortable night, while Omo falls immediately asleep.<br /><br />The next morning dawns chilly and clear as you groggily stumble from your shelter and stretch out your various aches and pains. Omo is already gone, but you don&#039;t worry about it too much, and after breaking out your trail rations for a morning meal you get down to studying your spellbook. The spell itself seems fairly straightforward, but the language it is couched in is unfamiliar and high-handed. You were taught your other General Magic spells by a patient teacher who could demonstrate the spell in action and speak in terms you could relate to- you learned the spell as a matter of instinct and emotion, and came to understand the details later. This book is technical, forcing you to deduce the process from the explanation of its workings. It is as though somebody tried to explain what a plus sign is by giving you 2+2+3=7 with no other explanation. It is, in a word, frustrating.<br /><br />Eventually, your grumbling and perseverance pays off when you finally manage to cast the spell. Waterproof makes an object non-absorbent for an hour per point of Mana, effectively preventing the water from harming the target. Large quantities of water (like a typhoon or complete submersion) can reduce the duration of the spell, but even so it should be more than enough to get across the river. Since it doesn&#039;t actually prevent contact, it doesn&#039;t work on acids or certain potions, and it doesn&#039;t rustproof. It&#039;s well suited for keeping paper, leather, and clothing dry, or preventing the dissolution of ink in water, and that&#039;s about it.<br /><br />You idly eat a light midday meal, wondering where Omo got to. After a few hours of fidgeting, you finally hear a rustling in the bushes, and soon see Omo hauling a sizable log on a makeshift sledge toward your clearing.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Hey Nym! This bloody thing was surprisingly hard to find- I really thought there would be more deadwood out here.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I was wondering where you went. Do you really think we need that large of a log?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">The way I figure, it can&#039;t hurt. Ready to go?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I think we should wait until it starts getting dark- we&#039;ll be harder to spot.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">I was hoping you&#039;d changed your mind. Alright- got anything to pass the time? Cards or dice? Anything?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Not really.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">...I spy with my little eye, something that is green.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Is it the forest?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Yep! Your turn!</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">*sigh* I spy with my little eye...</span><br /><br />Several hours of I Spy later, the sun begins to set. You quickly waterproof your spellbook before wrapping it and your scroll case in your cloak, just for insurance. The sun is down, but there is plenty of light to see by when you reach the river, and you pause for a moment in awe. The river is rather wide, but that&#039;s nothing special- you&#039;ve spent plenty of time around moving water. No, the sight that takes your breath away is the plains beyond. <br /><br />In Yicelafo, you&#039;ve never been able to see more than a hundred yards away- the forest is called the Walled Jungle for a reason. But here, at the edge of the woods, you can see for <em>miles</em>. The plains of Thrimesdur are covered with a blanket of tall, waving grass, broken only by the odd shrub or small tree. You can feel a gentle night breeze blowing your way, carrying the fresh scent of green spring grass and blooming flowers. You can see clear to the horizon, where the stars are beginning to shine in the eastern sky, and the Moon makes its triumphant debut. Almost, you imagine you can see beyond the plains, to the wasteland of the Sacred Grove, to the Black Swamp of the Golgothans, to the mountainhomes of the Dwarves, and beyond.<br /><br />Omo grins at you.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">So you feel it too, eh?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">What?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">The pull of far-off lands. The knowledge that there is more to see than you can possibly imagine, a world without walls. I&#039;ve felt it ever since my first patrol brought me to the border, not all that far north of here. You should see the mountains- majestic is the only word I have for them, and it is woefully inadequate.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Yeah... I think I understand you a little better, Omo.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Hm?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Nevermind- let&#039;s get this log in the water.</span><br /><br />Hastily, you drag the log to the river&#039;s edge, splashing into the shallows. The log floats low in the water, but it floats, and Omo expertly lashes your belongings to the top. Omo quickly shucks off his boots, shirt, and pants, tying them to the log.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Hurry up and strip, Nym!</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I&#039;ve got my tunic and boots off, I think I&#039;m alright with an undershirt, Omo.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">For the love of... look, the biggest danger in this river is getting too tired before we cross, and the more clothes you wear, the harder you have to swim. Not to mention if your unmentionables are wet, you&#039;ll catch your death of cold!</span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">Hey! Who&#039;s there?</span><br /><br />Glancing back, you see a Ranger emerging from the trees, bow in hand.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">No time! In we go!</span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">What are you doing? Stop!</span><br /><br />Plunging into the water, you wade into the current, quickly losing touch with the bottom. With Omo beside you, you begin kicking as well as you can, pushing your log further into the river. Hazarding a backward glance, you see the Ranger on the riverbank, arrow at his bowstring. Clearly he is reluctant to fire, and instead keeps yelling for you to return.<br /><br />Progress across the river is distressingly slow, as you and Omo find yourselves outmassed by the item-laden log. You distinctly feel you are floating downriver faster than you are crossing, but at least you are making headway. There&#039;s a bad moment at mid-river when you feel an undertow dragging at you, but <abbr title="8">you</abbr> and <abbr title="12">Omo</abbr> resist the pull and continue on. Soon enough, you can feel the current weakening, and your feet touch bottom on the opposite side. You wade ashore in Thrimesdur, sodden but free and away from Yicelafo.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Ha ha! Oh, but it is good to be out here.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">It certainly took long enough- that river looks a lot wider now that I&#039;ve swum it.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">So it does. Well, what do you say- should we camp here and head into Larathor tomorrow, or press on and sleep in an inn tonight? I don&#039;t know about you, but I&#039;m wet, cold, and hungry- food, fire and a bed sound like they&#039;re worth another hour&#039;s walk!</span><br /><br />You are about to agree as you shrug your tunic back on, but then you remember your promise to yourself. &quot;First night in the wilderness, away from settlement and elves- that&#039;s when I&#039;ll tell Omo I&#039;m a Necromancer.&quot; Maybe this doesn&#039;t count though- after all, Larathor isn&#039;t all <em>that </em>far off, and it might be better to wait until you are deeper in Thrimesdur.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- Test Command Undead by commanding something you&#039;ve raised to self-terminate.&nbsp; &nbsp;A further test of this would be if it could work on the undead that other necromancers have summoned.<br />- Test Command Undead, and see if can you over-ride commands given to a zombie summoned by another necromancer.&nbsp; Does the zombie respond to the most recent order given, or does it have loyalty to whomever summoned it?&nbsp; Or maybe it is under the control of the more powerful of the two necromancers.<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />- Steal Vitality on self<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recomend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Yicelafo<br /><a href="http://img.ie/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/6.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

Wouldn&#039;t Larathor be the first place they check?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">I&#039;m not sure, but I don&#039;t think there will be much pursuit. Certainly not until tomorrow morning, when the ferryman is awake to bring them over- I doubt they&#039;ll try to swim after us.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Alright, we&#039;ll spend the night in an inn, and leave first thing in the morning.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">If you say so.</span><br /><br />You briefly check your supplies, and find that everything survived warm and dry. Pulling on a dry shirt, you gather your things and follow Omo deeper inland, into the tall grass. Once out of sight of the river, Omo turns downriver, carefully guiding you around scrub bushes and animal burrows. You catch yourself eying the sky uneasily- it&#039;s so <em>big </em>out from under the trees, and you feel horribly exposed.<br /><br />Omo seems unbothered, frequently gazing up in delight as more and more stars emerge. Despite your nervousness, you have to admit that the gaping sky <em>is </em>rather spectacular. Stargazing is a rare treat in Yicelafo- you&#039;re accustomed to the narrow slices you can catch along the Great River or at the larger ponds. The pageantry of the cosmos is much grander when seen in its fullness, and while you recognize many of the constellations there are many more celestial bodies you&#039;ve never had occasion to see, let alone catalog. They are unfamiliar, strange, alien, and to a degree, disconcerting- but they are quite beautiful for all that.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t long at all before Larathor comes into sight, a vision that in some ways is as strange and exciting as the night sky. The town is surrounded by a high wooden wall, and you wonder where exactly they got all the lumber- you don&#039;t know of any lumber camps on the Elven side of the river. There are tall wooden towers dotted with torches at each corner of Larathor, as well as at the gatehouse. Pennons and flags snap in the breeze, dark shadows in the torchlight. The light of unnumbered candles, lanterns and torches within the walls gives the town an internal glow unlike anything in Yicelafo.<br /><br />As you approach the town walls, you see a pair of guards standing next to the open gates. One of them stops you before you enter.<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Good evening, travelers. What&#039;s your business?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">We&#039;re just on our way through- we&#039;ll stop for the night and be off in the morning.</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">And where are you bound?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">East.</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Burn me if that isn&#039;t peculiar- a warrior and a woman coming from the North in the middle of the night, bound for the East and the territory of Nightroar the Necromancer?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Hey, the sun only set like an hour ago.</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Blasted suspicious if you ask- ...wait a minute, you&#039;re <em>Elves</em>!</span></strong><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">What, did you think we were Necromancers?</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Sorry! Sorry, I didn&#039;t know- you have to admit, these are troubling times for mysterious strangers to arrive in the darkness. You Elves hardly ever leave your blasted forest- er, no offense intended. Are you here on official business? To help us against the Necromancer, I mean?</span></strong><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Well-</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Why else would a pair of Elves be heading East?</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Of course, stupid question. Burn me if it isn&#039;t good to hear good news for a change- I don&#039;t mind saying we need all the help we can get, with the attacks and all.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Attacks?</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Nightroar has been sending raiding parties West to terrorize the towns and farmlands. They don&#039;t seem very coordinated, but burn me if there aren&#039;t too many for the Imperial Chargers to handle. They can&#039;t be everywhere at once.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Troubling news, but if you don&#039;t mind, we&#039;re rather tired and have a long trip ahead of us. Do you know of a good inn we could stay at?</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Certainly, don&#039;t let me keep you. Ah, if you&#039;re looking for an inn I would recommend the Jolly Badger- a quality place, and the innkeeper is honest. It&#039;s on the main road heading south, can&#039;t miss it. Fare well on your travels!</span></strong><br /><br />You walk into Larathor, leaving the guards to gossip behind you. Once you are out of earshot, you pull your cloak up over your ears and give Omo a nudge.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Maybe it would be better if we weren&#039;t obviously Elves.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Eh? Why shouldn&#039;t we be what we are?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Because we stick out like a sore thumb, and we don&#039;t know if we&#039;re being pursued.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Oh. Fair enough.</span><br /><br />The streets of Larathor are nearly deserted at this hour- the main roads are well illuminated with street lamps, but the side streets are much darker, with only the occasional lantern casting a pool of light. The buildings here are tall, stone affairs, and to you the heavy structures seem to loom over the flagstone street- you&#039;ve never been someplace without <em>any</em> plants! Omo, as expected, is eager to drink it all in, peering down every side street, inspecting the detail of the iron lamp posts, gazing in delight at the taller structures, some four or five stories tall!<br /><br />Soon enough, you arrive at the inn the guard mentioned- the sign over the door depicts a dancing badger with a tankard of ale in each paw. Inside, you find the common room packed with patrons enjoying their drinks and the music of the performer in the corner. You sidle your way over to the bar, where the innkeeper is dispensing drinks. Explaining that you want a room, the smiling fat man waves a serving maid over to escort you upstairs in exchange for two silver pieces. The maid leads you to a small, well appointed room, and after you assure her that you need nothing else she returns downstairs. Omo looks towards the stairs and the sounds of laughter and singing, temptation clear on his face.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Y&#039;know, I think I&#039;ll just spend an hour or two downstairs. Get a feel for the lay of the land, maybe a drink.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Omo, not two hours ago you were swimming across a cold river fleeing Elven Rangers. We&#039;ll be leaving at first light, and you want to hit a tavern.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Not just a drink, I want to do some asking around, maybe get some info on what Nightroar has been up to.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Fine, I&#039;m not your mother. I get the bed though!</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Like I was gonna get that anyway. See you in the morning!</span><br /><br />Dropping your stuff, you settle down for the night. It&#039;s been a long day of hiking, swimming, and more hiking, and the bed is soft and warm- you fall almost immediately asleep. Early the next morning, you awake to the noise of Omo snoring on the floor. You lie back, taking in the unfamiliar sounds of city activity outside- the rumble of carts, the ring of horseshoes on stone, the muffled footsteps of somebody upstairs. You are tempted to sleep in, but don&#039;t want to waste any time.<br /><br />First things first- you pull out <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> and start flipping through it on the search for Illusion spells. While you find a couple minor auditory illusions, you are unable to find any optical illusions. Skimming the section on other Magics shows that Illusions of various kinds are widely used by Chaos Shaman, as well as Water Mystics and Air Seers. Stymied, you stow away your book and then beat Omo with your pillow.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Wake up! It&#039;s morning!</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Agh! Have a heart, Nym!</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Come on, we&#039;ve got time for breakfast and then we need to hit the road. I won&#039;t feel safe until we&#039;re out of Larathor.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">That&#039;s funny, I won&#039;t feel safe <em>after </em>we leave. The guard wasn&#039;t exaggerating about the undead attacks, if the common room is to be believed. The road south is choked with refugees. The Imperial Chargers are swamped, between trying to maintain order on the road while also responding to each zombie attack. The raids don&#039;t seem to be doing much damage themselves, but the reaction to the raids is crippling the Empire.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Is the Necromancer leading these attacks?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Life above, no. That&#039;s why the attacks are so ineffective- the undead are pretty stupid and uncoordinated. Nobody knows where Nightroar himself is, since none of the scouts sent to investigate have returned. We do know there is a hell of a lot of zombies a few days march east.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Can we go around?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">I don&#039;t know which way we should go, I don&#039;t have a map. We should probably buy one, and maybe some other things. And, y&#039;know, as long as we&#039;re out and about we could take in some of the sights...</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Omo, we need to leave as soon as possible.

Come on, our first day in a human town and you want to leave without seeing more than an inn? I was asking what there is to see last night, and the locals swear the temple here is one of the most beautiful on the Great River, and apparently there&#039;s a prominent actor at the theater in town, and you can get a great view of <em>everything</em> from the towers in the keep, and-</span><br /><br />You lean back, rubbing your temples as Omo babbles on. On the one hand, you don&#039;t want to spend any more time in town than you have to- you don&#039;t want any potential pursuit catching up with you, you want to come clean with Omo as soon as possible, and it feels like ages since you&#039;ve done any solid experimenting. On the other hand, it sounds like Omo is dying for some sightseeing and you&#039;re sure he&#039;s going to be unhappy if you leave straightaway, and it wouldn&#039;t hurt to get information from somebody other than a tavern full of drunks.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- Test Command Undead by commanding something you&#039;ve raised to self-terminate.&nbsp; &nbsp;A further test of this would be if it could work on the undead that other necromancers have summoned.<br />- Test Command Undead, and see if can you over-ride commands given to a zombie summoned by another necromancer.&nbsp; Does the zombie respond to the most recent order given, or does it have loyalty to whomever summoned it?&nbsp; Or maybe it is under the control of the more powerful of the two necromancers.<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />- Steal Vitality on self<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recomend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Yicelafo<br /><a href="http://img.ie/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/6.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

Alright! How about a compromise; we spend a couple hours gathering supplies, we spend a couple hours sightseeing, and leave after lunch. Sound good?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Are you sure we can&#039;t spare a single day?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Quite sure.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Alright, fine.

Then we can spend more time on the town.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Sounds good- what all do we need?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">A better map, at least, and we could stand to top off our supplies. I&#039;d like to find out just how easy it is to come by Crystal outside the Vale- I don&#039;t plan to do any buying, but it&#039;d be nice to know what kind of availability we&#039;re talking about. Here, this should cover it.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">It&#039;s a plan! See you in a bit!</span><br /><br />Omo scoops up the handful of copper you give him, scoops up his belongings and jauntily steps out the door. You take the time to rinse your face and hands in the washbasin before gathering your own supplies and heading downstairs. The common room is empty of the revelers from the night before, deserted save for a pair of merchants doing business at a table near the stairs. One gives you a surprised look, and you remember you don&#039;t have your cloak on- you mentally remind yourself to buy a headband when Omo gets back, to cover your ears at least.<br /><br />Waving the proprieter over, you hand over 5 copper in exchange for a hearty meal of hot porridge mixed with dried apples. As you eat, you open <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> to the chapter that discusses the other Magical Faiths. Although the dissertation on the theory of Magic is dense and uninteresting, you do manage to glean some useful tidbits of knowledge.<br /><br />The Elemental Magics form the basis of, well, everything- some living things are more suited for one form of Magic than others (which is why Merfolk tend towards Water spells, and not Fire) but most creatures have equal affinity for each element- whatever that means. <span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Fire </strong></span>magic deals with control of fire, obviously, but also volcanoes and lava, light, and matters of the soul. <span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Water</strong></span> magic, besides control of the element, is also heavily involved with the fundamental processes of living things and their base instincts, with a wide variety of related applications ranging from healing to divination and illusion. Water Mystics are widely regarded as the best healing available short of an Elf (which, given the reclusiveness of the Elves, often translates to &quot;the best healing available.&quot;) <span style="color: teal;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Air </strong></span>magic is heavily tied to storms and the weather, as well as affairs of the mind- the Text is less clear on this Faith than the others. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Earth </strong></span>magic deals with the shaping of stones and dirt, as well as knowledge of what lies in the depths. Many subterranean creatures are strongly Earth aligned, as well.<br /><br />The Derived Magics have quite a bit more detail, so for now you just skim the highlights. <strong>Order</strong> draws on the innate propensity of things to self-organize- it doesn&#039;t explain it any better than that, since it is assumed that the reader already has a basic knowledge of Order Magic. You do have a pretty good idea of what Order is useful for, though- Order Wizards have access to the most potent divinations in the world, as well as defensive abilities strong enough to ward entire armies. They also have some small healing talent, though not nearly so much as practitioners of Water or Life. <strong><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">Chaos</span></strong> is not well understood, which perhaps makes sense given the nature of the text&#039;s author. It does detail quite a few known abilities of Chaos Shaman gleaned from centuries of enmity, however. Chaos is used in a variety of ways, altering luck, sowing discord on the battlefield through illusions and mind-altering effects, and truly puissant Shaman have the power to transform their foes into harmless rabbits (or their friends into powerful monsters!)<br /><br />The entry on <strong><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">Life </span></strong>magic doesn&#039;t tell you anything you didn&#039;t know (and in fact, some of the details you know to be wrong,) but the entry on <strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Necromancy </span></strong>has its own little chapter. Unfortunately, it has very little information on the practical abilities of Necromancers- instead it focuses on the detection and removal of Necromancer threats. Quite frankly, even that information seems of limited use- you know from personal experience that Necromancers do <em>not </em>blight plants wherever they walk, nor do they lose all their hair when they manifest their powers! Most of this chapter seems to boil down to &quot;if weird stuff is going on, keep the suspected Necromancer sedated and wait for more powerful Wizards to divine the truth.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Hey bookworm, done yet?</span><br />You jump in surprise as Omo plops down next to you. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Bloody... yeah, I&#039;m ready to go. Did you have trouble buying supplies?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Nope- well, I haven&#039;t heard a price on your Crystal yet. Apparently only the biggest cities support enough magic users to warrant a shop for the selling of it- mostly towns order a supply from the Caravans and wait for it to be delivered. I did hear that the temples keep a ready supply of Crystal, however, and will probably sell at cost.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">You heard this? From who?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">A priest at a bar. He said if we wanted to know more, we could swing by the Temple and talk with one of the priests who are in charge of such things. And since I wanted to go there anyway...</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Alright, alright, let me stow my things. Also, we need headbands to hide our ears.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Right, so instead of being beautiful, graceful strangers with pointy ears we&#039;ll just be beautiful, graceful strangers with odd fashion sense.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">I choose to ignore your tone. Let&#039;s go!</span><br /><br />As it turns out, the Jolly Badger is situated quite near the merchant district, and you find a cloth merchant with little trouble. For a few copper, you buy a short length of rough, plain white wool cloth, and cut it into wide strips for use as headbands. Moving through the crowds, you can tell it isn&#039;t doing much to distract attention from yourselves, but at least you aren&#039;t obviously Elves now.<br /><br />Omo leads you North along the main road, to a wide plaza where it meets the East/West trade route. You take a few minutes to admire the statue at the center of the plaza. It&#039;s a very old statue, perhaps as old as the Golgothan War, and depicts a human pikeman shielding a young Elven woman with a child on her back. A weathered bronze plaque at its base somberly informs you that the statue represents the role the humans of Thrimesdur played in protecting the Elven Refugees from agents of the Necromancer. Not only is it quite the feel-good story, but the settling of Yicelafo led directly to increased land trade between Thrimesdur and points West, which ultimately resulted in the current prosperity of Larathor.<br /><br />You wonder if this is how all the humans in Thrimesdur view themselves- defenders of the weak and helpless. It certainly seems like they are a more noble people than the Elders were giving them credit for when you were at their Council. Then again, the men and women who defended the Refugees are long dead, while many of the very same Elves who were defended are still alive- perhaps the Elders are familiar with their descendents, and find the current generation of humans lacking.<br /><br />Omo (quite literally) pulls you from your reflection and across the plaza to the Temple. The structure is enormous- while the Temples of the Elves are commonly constructed around trees or places of natural beauty, the Temple of Order is a tall, stone building in the shape of a cross. The center of the cross is a belltower rising high above the cityscape. The cross is circumscribed by a low stone wall- the empty quadrants bound by the building and the wall both have a single gazebo in their center, surrounded be neatly arranged flowerbeds cut by straight cobblestone paths.<br /><br />Coming closer, you can see that the stonework of the building is decorated with simple patterns and mazes. The front gates are flanked by tall, ornately decorated columns. Pushing the massive iron-bound doors open, you slip inside and stop in wonder. The antechamber has a high, vaulted ceiling, with colored glass windows allowing rays of sunlight to slant inside. The walls are covered in engravings of all kinds, and while you don&#039;t know their significance you can&#039;t deny their beauty.<br /><br />A passing priest in flowing cream robes smiles as he approaches you.<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Hail, pilgrims! Mid-morning services will begin shortly, if you&#039;d like to grab a seat.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Actually, we&#039;re just passing through before we have to leave town- we&#039;d heard that this was a beautiful Temple.</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Well! I hope it did not disappoint!</span></strong><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">No, not at all. We don&#039;t have any stonework like this at home.</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Oh? Where do you hail from? I can tell you aren&#039;t local.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Er, we come from the West. Actually, I had heard you also sell Crystal- is that right?</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Indeed it is- the Temples of Order will sell to any friend of Thrimesdur at no profit to themselves. Magic users frequently further The Plan regardless of their specific orientation, even more so than common men.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">The Plan?</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">We believe that there is a higher power acting through all of us, from the lowliest serf to the highest king, even the Gods. We hold that this purpose is the betterment of all creation, for creation itself could not exist without its orderly influence- all things, good or ill, have a reason for occurring.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Is that what these engravings represent? Steps in the Plan?</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">A good guess, but no. The engravings in this chamber depict our history, and what came before- even though the future seems uncertain and indeterminate, it is merely a matter of perspective, for one day the flow of events will seem as inevitable and planned as our own history. Ah, but I&#039;ve babbled enough- if you&#039;re looking for a theological discussion, feel free to find me after services.</span></strong><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">No thank you, we&#039;re just here to appreciate your surroundings.</span><br /><strong><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">That&#039;s wonderful- feel free to wander and admire at your will, restricted areas are clearly marked. I&#039;d give you a guided tour, but I have services to conduct. Enjoy your visit!</span></strong><br /><br />With that, he moves deeper into the building. Although you feel time pressing on you, you do in fact enjoy this visit- the Temple has a serene, secure quality at odds with the bustling town outside, and while the meaning of the many artworks is lost on you it is easy to appreciate the craftsmanship of their making. You and Omo spend more than an hour wandering the Temple, examining statuary and engravings, paintings and tapestries.<br /><br />Afterwards, you elect to simply wander the city, experiencing the bustling atmosphere of a prosperous human town and taking in the architecture, so unlike that of home. It seems that every plaza has a statue, some of inscriptions detailing a tidbit of the history of Larathor and the river trade, many with nothing to explain their presence. You rather suspect that there is a reason for each artwork- from your conversation with the priest, you&#039;d wager everything in this town is planned and plotted by somebody. There is little spontaneity among the humans of Thrimesdur, quite unlike the impulsive Elves.<br /><br />Eventually your sightseeing leads you to the keep- the doors are open to the public, although there are many guardsmen about keeping a watchful eye on strangers. You find yourself atop one of the walls, looking out over the sloped rooftops and the outer wall to the fields of grass and the farmland beyond. As the Temple Bell sounds the noon hour, you turn to Omo.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Alright, I think we&#039;ve had enough fun for one day. We need to get ready for the next leg of our journey.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Yeah, yeah... I suppose you&#039;re right. OK. I got this map while I was out this morning.</span><br /><br /><a href="http://tnypic.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Omo, I certainly hope you didn&#039;t pay <em>money </em>for this! It looks like it was scribbled on the back of a napkin!</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Yeah, it might not have been so much &quot;me buying a map&quot; as &quot;me asking for directions and sketching them&quot; at the bar.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Oh, Omo.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Hey, it&#039;s perfectly serviceable! The red dots are the larger farming villages along the road, and the green bits are farmland. Water gets harder to come by further inland, so farms get few and far between once you&#039;re past the villages. Figure a good day&#039;s travel East will get us that far- after that, it&#039;s the wilderness.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Nuts, I thought the wilderness was closer than that.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Eh?</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Nothing. So, if I&#039;m reading this right, it&#039;s 100 miles to... Axle penne?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Er, no, I smudged that big. It&#039;s supposed to say Atkilpeme- it&#039;s the Captial of Thrimesdur. When we get there, we&#039;ll be almost halfway to the Sacred Grove. It&#039;s the getting there that&#039;ll be tricky, though.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">How tricky is tricky?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">It depends how you want to tackle this, I suppose. If we follow the road, we&#039;ll almost certainly run into the forces of the Necromancer along the way. If we wanted to avoid him, we could detour North into Bothoninen, The Murky Hills. The problem with that is that we&#039;d run the risk of running into goblins or other monsters raiding from the mountains. If we detoured South around the Necromancer, we&#039;d come to Aloclesno, The Shaken Forest.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">That doesn&#039;t sound so bad. We can handle forest.</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">Well, supposedly, Aloclesno is haunted. Like, <em>really </em>haunted. In the &quot;none who enter&quot; leave sense of the word. That might just be superstition, but the guy I was talking to laughed pretty hard when I suggested that route.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Hm. What do you think?</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">If we leave now, we can probably make that second village before nightfall. After that, we&#039;ll be leaving civilization and need to pick our direction. Going straight along the road should take us two/three days, while detouring could take as long as five. The thing is, we don&#039;t know exactly where the Necromancer is- he could be well north or south of the main road and easy to avoid, or he could be squatting on the whole thing with a massive army stretched out to either side.</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Hm...</span><br /><br />It&#039;s a tricky situation- going North could result in an encounter with bloodthirsty goblinoid savages, while going South means entering a mysterious, supposedly cursed forest. And somewhere straight ahead is the Necromancer Curo Nightroar himself, and the bulk of his undead forces...<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 10/10<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 12/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 19/20<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">82 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Headband, Belt Knife, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="3 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr>, <abbr title="can swim in calm, peaceful waters">Dabbling Swimmer</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Pondering<br /><strong>Nineteen</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - Detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - Causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - You can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><strong>Waterproof</strong>- 1MP/Hour duration - Makes an object non-absorbent.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways.

Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6.

We should simply be able to go south to the intersection, then east to that road. That way we completely avoid all the dangerous things.<br /><br />However...before we decide:<br /><br /><strong>Quick price check on horses</strong><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That was actually exactly what I was going for. +1 cookie for you!<br /><br />Mounts can be quite useful, but are also expensive. A pony costs 30 silver- if you buy two, you would be faster over short distances (escaping enemies) but not appreciably faster over long distance. If you had 3 ponies (the third to hold your supplies and distribute your weight) you would travel faster overland, from 24 miles/day to 32. Ponies would indeed be able to accompany you through the forest, you just wouldn&#039;t be much faster than if you were on foot for that portion.<br /><br />The other option would be a light horse. They are much faster than ponies (in fact, they&#039;re the fastest available mount) but they cost 75 silver a pop. However, even riding double with Omo you would move faster than on foot, at the 32 mile/day pace. If you managed to secure 3 horses (one for you, Omo, and your supplies) you&#039;d travel at a blistering 48 miles/day. Horses, like ponies, would be able to accompany you through the forest, they would simply be slower.<br /><br />Neither option would be war-trained, meaning they could spook in tough situations (Calm Animal can solve this situation,) and the costs do not include such niceties as saddles, saddlebags, bridles, etc. Those items are not strictly necessary (especially given your Elvenness) but a pack animal would need something to carry its burden with. Saddlebags only cost 4 silver, but don&#039;t hold all too much. A pack saddle would cost 15 silver and allow the animal to carry as much as it can stand up under, which is quite a bit.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3197963#msg3197963">Quote from: Cellmonk on Mon 16-04-2012, 08:43:38</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Seems like native fauna might be very useful for transportation, in the long run.

I&#039;ll just reiterate that each part is linked from the OP, for people who want the context to the above quote (or want to look up anything else for that matter.) I can neither confirm nor deny that this spell works differently when cast on Golems than it does on Zombies. Something to look into.<br /><br />For the record, I&#039;m also working REALLY hard not to go all Socratic on this thread. I&#039;d rather pose the interesting questions through gameplay, after all, and watching y&#039;all labor under misapprehensions just makes the Eureka moment more satisfying anyway. Why yes, I am a jerk, why do you ask? You&#039;ve certainly raised some good points, though.</div>

Don&#039;t mind the six month hiatus. I make no promises about frequency of updates, especially with the holiday season coming up, but we&#039;re back. Game on.<br /><br />For anyone who doesn&#039;t remember what the hell we&#039;re doing here, I will remind you that each part is linked in the OP for quick reference, whether you want to read the whole shebang again or if you just want to refresh yourself on the particulars of one of your known spells or whatever.<br /><br />tl;dr - You are heading to the wasteland formerly known as the Sacred Grove, ancestral homeland of the Elves, in the hopes of being able to remove whatever curse despoils that land. The first leg of your journey takes you south to Aloclesno, &quot;The Shaken Forest.&quot; With any luck, you&#039;ll be able to circumvent the forces of the vile (and supposedly insane) Necromancer Curo Nightroar while also avoiding whatever evil thing haunts the forest. But first, you need to reveal your true nature to Omo Thunderjaw, your best friend and traveling companion.<br /></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3198361#msg3198361">Quote from: RAM on Mon 16-04-2012, 15:05:51</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I say south. It is a forest, we are elves. Given that the locals are spooked, we should stick to the edge if we can, but stay close enough to seek refuge inside the forest without being seen. And we still haven&#039;t mentioned to Omo that we have an important secret to tell them...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Omo gestures at the map, tracing your possible paths with his finger. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;If we leave now, we can probably make that second village before nightfall. After that, we&#039;ll be leaving civilization and need to pick our direction. Going straight along the road should take us two/three days, while detouring could take as long as five. The thing is, we don&#039;t know exactly where the Necromancer is- he could be well north or south of the main road and easy to avoid, or he could be squatting on the whole thing with a massive army stretched out to either side.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Hm... I say we go South. Both ways seem dangerous, but we&#039;re both much more familiar with forests than hills. Besides, we can probably just skirt around the edge of the forest if we need to- you said it was only people who went <em>into </em>the forest that vanished, right?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, he wasn&#039;t very clear on the specifics, but that sounds reasonable. The villages closer to the forest probably have more information.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Good enough- next stop, Aloclesno!&quot;</span><br /><br />Shouldering your pack, you accompany Omo down from the walls of the keep before purposefully leading him to the Eastern gate of Larathor. The enormous, iron-strapped wooden doors stand open, vigilant guards on the parapets and tower keeping watch on the traffic below. Most of the incoming travelers appear to be dispossessed farmers- refugees from the depredations of the Necromancer. You and Omo are the only travelers going East.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3198057#msg3198057">Quote from: Grek on Mon 16-04-2012, 09:52:00</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Go check the horse prices and get mounted if the price is at all reasonable. Ride on until out of sight of town, then stop and tell Omo what we need to tell him. If all goes well, he won&#039;t freak and we&#039;ll have time to go to the first village on our route and stop for the night. The next day, we ride on to the third village and detour south through the haunted forest. Sound good?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3077974#msg3077974">Quote from: GlyphGryph on Fri 09-03-2012, 19:41:01</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But yes, once we are beyond the edge of the forests, we will truly resume our experiments in earnest. There will be one last thing that needs to be done, though, first. Perhaps a days travel past the boundaries, we will tell Omo there is something we need to show and explain to him. Remind him that he knows us fairly well, and we wouldn&#039;t have kept something secret from him this long unless it was important - and to hear us out, in full, before making any decisions. But we hope he decides to stay with us - we need him, not just for his abilities to fight and survive off the land, but to be our ethical compass and a reminder of what we have to lose should we err. Tell him you will explain the rest once camp is set.<br /><br />Once we&#039;ve set up camp in a well secluded area, ask him to hunt us up something for dinner while you prepare your story. Once he returns, start at the beginning. Explain how your powers revealed themselves - and how if you didn&#039;t use them, they manifested themselves on their own. Ignoring them wasn&#039;t an option, so you attempted to learn about them. You don&#039;t need to go into details about the specific experiments, simply tell him of the things you learned, and of coming to terms with this. Of your internal conflict, and renewed determination to do something good with what you have realized is a gift. Pevo has told us that not all Necromancers are evil - merely, humans expressing the magic on their own without guidance corrupts an already dangerous discipline even further. Our nature, our life experience, allows us a different path - though we are wary of the dangers, and we wish to rely on Omo to keep us on the straight and narrow.<br /><br />Then explain how, with these powers, we believe we have a chance to do what the Life Mages could not - remove the taint from our elven homeland. Perhaps it will be beyond our abilities, but if nothing else there is surely something valuable to be learned. If we can learn how to turn our powers in such a way so as to counter the undead, even better - we can use those powers defending out people, should it come to that.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3077281#msg3077281">Quote from: Grek on Fri 09-03-2012, 10:58:26</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">At no point should we outright state &quot;I&#039;m a Necromancer, Omo.&quot; Doing so will only scare him. <br /><br />Instead, we should tell him our story. How one day we went fishing and the fish came back to life. How we went to sleep one night and woke up from a nightmare to find that our bait had risen from the dead. How we discovered that the only way to keep from accidentally making undead was to exhaust our mana every day. Tell him that we&#039;re scared and we don&#039;t want to become a monster like the necromancers are, but we&#039;re also scared of telling anyone because they&#039;d want to kill us. Explain that we&#039;ve managed to learn enough to keep any accidents under control until we could destroy them, and that we hope that we can do something good with the power, something that will convince the world that we&#039;re not evil, not dangerous, and that, until then, we plan to hide our powers and keep out of trouble. If he hasn&#039;t attacked us yet, answer his questions as honestly as possible without incriminating ourselves. We&#039;ve not done anything really wrong, so that should be easy.<br /><br />Further, the golem thing probably isn&#039;t the best idea. Omo is sure to be weirded out by the idea that we&#039;ve been using necromancy behind his back the whole trip. If he wants proof, and <strong>only</strong> if he wants proof, offer to raise a dead bug or something small like that. The golem can come later, when we&#039;re telling him about our plans to use necromancy to fight necromancy and defeat the evil necromancers by undoing their magic.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Though he clearly wanted to explore Larathor more, Omo quickly gets a spring in his step as he leads the way to the horizon. You, on the other hand... you do not relish telling Omo your secret. It&#039;s the kind of thing that would shock and appall any elf, and you&#039;ve got no idea how your childhood friend will respond. You&#039;ve been wanting to tell him for ages now, but the time just hasn&#039;t been right. Further waiting is intolerable- as soon as Larathor is out of sight!<br /><br />You step off the road along with Omo as a group of armed horsemen ride by, Imperial Chargers cantering East on patrol. What are you going to say? It&#039;s not something you can really just blurt out- there needs to be a certain amount of buildup. You&#039;re going to shock him, but there&#039;s no need to figuratively slap him in the face with it.<br /><br />You continue on your way after the soldiers pass. After an hour or so of walking, you finally decide you&#039;ve put enough distance between yourself and Larathor- with no other travelers in sight, this is about as private as you&#039;re likely to be for the next few days.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Hey, Omo? Omo, wait up. I, uh, I need to talk to you.&quot;</span><br />Omo looks back at you, slowing to a stop. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yeah? What&#039;s up? Something&#039;s been eating you all afternoon.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yeah.. um. I, uh, might not have been <em>entirely </em>forthright with you about my reasons for leaving Yicelafo.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I kinda figured- you&#039;ve never been one for roughing it before.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;No kidding- my feet are... not important right now. So, uh, about three weeks ago some weird stuff started happening around me. I mean, really, it&#039;s been going on for months now- odd headaches, and waking up with no Mana, and... kinda being <em>aware </em>of Vitality around me. I just dismissed it at the time, figured I was drunk or eating some bad fish or something. But three weeks ago, that&#039;s when it started happening a lot and when I was out fishing I brought a fish back to life.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You what?&quot;</span><br />You raise your hands. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Just hear me out, okay? I did some experimenting, trying to figure out what happened, what my powers were. I found out that if I didn&#039;t use them, the powers would manifest themselves. So I brought back some more stuff, and learned more about controlling it, and I started preparing to leave Yicelafo since I knew my gift would be used best away from the Vale.&quot;</span><br />Omo looks horribly confused, scratching at his prominent chin. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Nym. What exactly are you saying?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I&#039;m a... uh, Necromancer. I&#039;m a Necromancer, Omo.&quot;</span><br /><br />There is a long silence as Omo visibly processes your statement, his face bouncing from bewilderment, to surprise, to horror, to concern, and back to confusion.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;That&#039;s what I was doing spending so much time with Pevo, I wanted to learn more about Necromancers. He thinks they go bad because they&#039;re only human, and I&#039;m an Elf, Omo! I can use my powers for good, and fight the evil Necromancers, and-&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Stop! Just, hang on... have you said this to anyone else? Pevo? Elana?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;No. You&#039;re the only one I&#039;ve told. Nobody else suspects anything. But I can&#039;t lie to you, you&#039;re my best friend. We&#039;re traveling together, and you deserve to know.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I just... You can&#039;t be a Necromancer! Think about it logically, Nym- Elves aren&#039;t Necromancers, it just doesn&#039;t happen!&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, it did. I&#039;m still going to the Sacred Grove- I think I can reverse whatever was done there. At the very least, I have a better shot than anyone else, since I can see Necromancy spells. Are... you going to come with me?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You&#039;re not joking. Are you joking? Because if you&#039;re joking, you&#039;ve picked up a very good deadpan you&#039;ve never had before.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Omo, I&#039;m dead serious. I am a Necromancer.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;No, Necromancers are big and scary with bone-studded armor, or skull-topped staffs, or <em>something</em>! You don&#039;t look like a Necromancer, you just look like Nym!&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I&#039;m still Nym! Necromancy is just part of who I am now.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Listen, Nym, I&#039;m your best friend. I&#039;ve got your back- always have, always will. So you need to listen to what I&#039;m about to say- you are crazy. Your eggs are scrambled. I don&#039;t know if you hit your head or what, but you need to go back to Yicelafo.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Burn you, I&#039;m not crazy!&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Come on, Nym, think about it. What&#039;s more likely- something knocked what little sense you had loose, causing subtle changes in behavior, indecisiveness, and delusions of grandeur, or that you&#039;ve somehow manifested Terrible and Fell Magics unknown to our entire race?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Grrr...&quot;</span><br /><br />You can&#039;t tell whether Omo is in denial or just dense (although knowing Omo, the latter is quite likely,) but this approach isn&#039;t going very well. Glancing around, there does not appear to be anyone else within sight of the road- perhaps a demonstration is in order, if you can&#039;t think of a better way to convince him. Unless you just feel like ignoring the issue until you&#039;re wandering a haunted forest...<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 10/10<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 12/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 19/20<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">82 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Headband, Belt Knife, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="3 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr>, <abbr title="can swim in calm, peaceful waters">Dabbling Swimmer</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Frustrated<br /><strong>Nineteen</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - Detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - Causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - You can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><strong>Waterproof</strong>- 1MP/Hour duration - Makes an object non-absorbent.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- Test Command Undead by commanding something you&#039;ve raised to self-terminate.&nbsp; &nbsp;A further test of this would be if it could work on the undead that other necromancers have summoned.<br />- Test Command Undead, and see if can you over-ride commands given to a zombie summoned by another necromancer.&nbsp; Does the zombie respond to the most recent order given, or does it have loyalty to whomever summoned it?&nbsp; Or maybe it is under the control of the more powerful of the two necromancers.<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />- Steal Vitality on self<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Northwest Thrimesdur<br /><a href="http://tnypic.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

Don&#039;t simply spring the demonstration on him. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Listen, just-&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Omo, I&#039;m a Necromancer. It isn&#039;t that hard to prove. C&#039;mon, help me find a bug.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;A bug?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Y&#039;know, vermin. Oh hang on, here we go.&quot;</span><br /><br />Resting your pack on the ground, you carefully lean over the anthill you&#039;ve discovered by the side of the road. Isolating a nice big soldier ant, you pop off its head and carry the twitching corpse over to Omo.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Here- this ant is dead, right? Watch. I&#039;m going to zombify it.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Nym...&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Shush! The first zombie I made was an ant just like this one, right down to the severed head...&quot;</span><br /><br />It has been a while since you cast <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Raise Zombie</strong></span></span></span>, but the spell goes off just as you expected; the familiar rush of icy energy surging from you to the ant, the ant writhing and standing up, a small purple flame taking the place of its head.<br /><br />Omo&#039;s eyes bug out as the ant begins picking a path across your outstretched hand, but you are distracted from his reaction by the brief moment of vertigo associated with gaining a level- your Vitality goes up a little! As you gaze upon your creation, you discover that your Necromantic Sight seems to have changed- you now see in more detail. Not only do you sense the Necromantic Energy animating the corpse, but you can see how it twists and turns throughout the body. Most of the Necromantic Energy (as well as the rather insignificant amount of Vitality) is concentrated in the head, but with your new sight you can sense a tiny, intricate network of Necromantic Energy woven through the major parts of the ant&#039;s body- the legs and the core of the body, mostly. Further, your newly refined senses inform you that the Vitality of the ant is contained within that network. Encapsulated by it, would perhaps be-<br /><br />Your curious examination of the tiny ant and its tiny parts is rudely interrupted when Omo regains enough composure to speak.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Blood and bloody flaming ashes, Nym! You brought that flaming ant back to life!&quot;</span><br />Seeing that you&#039;ve made your point, you crush the ant in your hands and let the body fall to the ground. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yes, I did. As I&#039;ve been saying for the past five minutes now, I am a Necromancer.&quot;</span><br />Omo stares at the fallen ant before helplessly looking back to you. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yeah, but... oh, burn me Nym, my best friend can&#039;t be a Necromancer!&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You keep saying that, yes. I&#039;m... very sorry if I can&#039;t be your best friend now.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Burn me, Nym, I didn&#039;t mean it like-&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Then how did you mean it, huh? You&#039;re still my best friend, but I can&#039;t very well stop being a Necromancer. I&#039;m not evil- I&#039;m going to find a way to use my powers for good. That&#039;s why I&#039;m going to the Sacred Grove- to try and do some good. So... are you going to come with me? Please?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Bloody... you can&#039;t just spring this on a guy, you know? Just... gimme some time to think about it.&quot;</span><br /><br />Omo slowly continues down the road, and you hastily grab your pack and run up to walk alongside him. Omo keeps his gaze on the road, ignoring your attempts to catch his eye. With a sigh, you resign yourself to silence for the next leg of your journey.<br /><br />Before long, you begin passing more and more farms as you approach the first village on the highway. It isn&#039;t much of a village- a couple brick inns and a stone temple surrounded by houses. A single watch tower to the East serves as the only defense for the villagers- certainly nothing capable of repelling a zombie horde. That said, there are plenty of farmers and villagers going about their business. Although the atmosphere is tense and worried, nobody seems to be on the brink of abandoning their town and fleeing to Larathor.<br /><br />Omo doesn&#039;t stop here, so neither do you, and you quickly pass beyond village limits. Once you have a semblance of privacy on the lonely road, Omo breaks the silence.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So... have you raised a lot of zombies, then?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Not really, actually. Some bugs. A fish. A tree, by accident.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;...you <em>accidentally</em> zombified a tree?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yeah, well, this is harder than it looks. I don&#039;t really know what I&#039;m doing, and every time I learn something I just find there&#039;s a dozen other things I don&#039;t know about. Like, okay, apparently I can make golems? I stuffed a bunch of Vitality in a rock, anyway.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Weird.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</span><br /><br />The next dozen steps pass in silence.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Okay, so, do you know anything about the other Necromancers?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;No. Well, I know what you know- they&#039;re out there and apparently evil. Well, actually, have we heard of any atrocities being performed by the Pirate King?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Nothing specific, I guess. I just kinda did the math that Necromancers equal Evil.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I can tell you that isn&#039;t true, so I&#039;m not willing to write off the Pirate King so quickly. He&#039;s ambitious, maybe, but that doesn&#039;t mean he has to be evil.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It&#039;s bloody strange though- there being three Necromancers, I mean. Two of them active at the same time, alright, I can believe that. But three?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I don&#039;t know, Omo.&quot;</span><br /><br />A family of farmers approaches from the East, their worldly possessions piled high on a broad, sturdy wagon. You exchange a friendly nod as their wagon clatters past, on their way to refuge in Larathor. You wait until they are well out of earshot before resuming your conversation.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So... convinced I&#039;m not crazy and evil yet?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Heh. Well, you&#039;ve always been crazy.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;And...&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;And I don&#039;t really believe you have an evil bone in your body, no.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So are you coming with me? I could really use a friend.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Burn me, Nym. Yeah, I&#039;ll go along with you. Somebody&#039;s got to keep you out of troub- gah!&quot;</span><br /><br />Your tackle hug catches him a bit off-guard, and he shoves you off with a laugh. You spend the remainder of your travel speaking of inconsequential things, simply enjoying one another&#039;s company.<br /><br />As the sun sets, you arrive at the next village. Unlike the last one, this village is surrounded with a low earthen wall and moat- judging by the soldiers still driving sharpened stakes into the wall, its construction is recent. The road is barricaded with overturned carts and heavy barrels, forming an impromptu gate. The soldiers on guard wave you through with little more than a cursory glance before returning to their nightly preparations.<br /><br />The whole village is full of soldiers- although there does seem to be some villagers moving about, much of the traffic is off-duty infantry. Entering one of the inns, you find the common room entirely populated by soldiers, with the innkeeper and a few serving wenches struggling to keep up with the demands for food and booze. With a little difficulty, you flag down the innkeeper.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Excuse me? I&#039;m guessing all your rooms are taken by soldiers, but do you have any lodging available? A spot by the fire, maybe?&quot;</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Well, if you want a spot by the fire I can oblige you later tonight when the crowd thins out, but as it happens I do have rooms available for rent. Most of the soldiers are quartered in abandoned houses, leaving me free to run my business.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Oh, well that&#039;s a relief! Yes, we&#039;d like a room and a hot meal, then. I take it these soldiers are here to fight the Necromancer, then?&quot;</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;They&#039;re here to fight zombies, anyway. There are attacks every few nights, either here or out in the countryside.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Why are the soldiers here? Why aren&#039;t they at the next village down the road?&quot;</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Is that where you&#039;re bound? I hope you don&#039;t have any family out that way- most of the villagers died in the early attacks, and the ones that survived fled. The village is abandoned now, and in truth most farms East of here are abandoned as well. The Imperial Army patrols every night, but if they&#039;re ten minutes away when the dead knock on your door they can&#039;t do much other than bury you afterwards.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I see. Well, we&#039;ll figure something out. Now, our rooms?&quot;</span><br /><br />For two silver pieces, you get to enjoy a <abbr title="Maybe not the best stew, and you aren&#039;t sure what the meat is, but it&#039;s warm and filling">bowl of stew</abbr> and all the bawdy soldier songs you can stand. Unsurprisingly, it turns out Omo can stand the singing much better than you can, and you retire early to your room. It&#039;s not quite as fine as the room you stayed at in Larathor, but the sheets are clean and the blankets thick. Throwing a quilt on the floor for Omo, you burrow into the narrow bed and <span style="color: #000000;" class="bbc_color">q</span><span style="color: #090308;" class="bbc_color">u</span><span style="color: #120510;" class="bbc_color">i</span><span style="color: #1B0819;" class="bbc_color">c</span><span style="color: #230A21;" class="bbc_color">k</span><span style="color: #2C0D29;" class="bbc_color">l</span><span style="color: #350F31;" class="bbc_color">y</span><span style="color: #3E1239;" class="bbc_color"> </span> <span style="color: #471442;" class="bbc_color">f</span><span style="color: #50174A;" class="bbc_color">a</span><span style="color: #581952;" class="bbc_color">l</span><span style="color: #611C5A;" class="bbc_color">l</span><span style="color: #6A1E63;" class="bbc_color"> </span> <span style="color: #73216B;" class="bbc_color">a</span><span style="color: #7C2373;" class="bbc_color">s</span><span style="color: #85267B;" class="bbc_color">l</span><span style="color: #8D2883;" class="bbc_color">e</span><span style="color: #962B8C;" class="bbc_color">e</span><span style="color: #9F2D94;" class="bbc_color">p</span><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">.<br /><br />You are sitting by your favorite fishing hole. It&#039;s dark, but that&#039;s alright- the fishes glow purple, and they&#039;re easy to spot. You idly dip your bare feet in the pond- the water is icy cold, but it doesn&#039;t bother you. Pulling your shirt over your head, you cast it aside before slipping into the water.<br /><br />Your feet slap on cold stone as you arrive. This is a strange room- you don&#039;t think you&#039;ve been here before. A small wooden table with two chairs stand before you- across the stone chamber, a large leather sofa is seated directly before a roaring fireplace. Smoothing your nightgown, you glance up at the ceiling before quickly averting your gaze- the ceiling is Dangerous.<br /><br />Despite the fire, this room is cold, and you look for a way out. There don&#039;t appear to be any windows or doors, however. Looking behind you, you see only the same wall as the rest of the chamber.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><span style="text-shadow: #FF00FF 1px 1px 1px">&quot;Well it&#039;s about time!&quot;</span></span><br /><br />Startled, you quickly turn around. Standing with her back to you on the other side of the sofa is a young, red-haired human woman wearing a blue dress embroidered with little black skulls along the sleeves. She turns slowly, cradling a glass of wine in her fingers.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><span style="text-shadow: #FF00FF 1px 1px 1px">&quot;You know, I thought it was odd when Mokra told me another Necromancer would arise- it wasn&#039;t in the plan, y&#039;know? And then you took so long to-&quot;</span></span><br /><br />Her emerald green eyes widen in shock when she sees you.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><span style="text-shadow: #FF00FF 1px 1px 1px">&quot;You&#039;re an <em>elf maiden</em>?!? An elf.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- Test Command Undead by commanding something you&#039;ve raised to self-terminate.&nbsp; &nbsp;A further test of this would be if it could work on the undead that other necromancers have summoned.<br />- Test Command Undead, and see if can you over-ride commands given to a zombie summoned by another necromancer.&nbsp; Does the zombie respond to the most recent order given, or does it have loyalty to whomever summoned it?&nbsp; Or maybe it is under the control of the more powerful of the two necromancers.<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />- Steal Vitality on self<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8.

You can also give orders that will persist beyond the end of the spell.<br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Steal Vitality</span></strong></span></span>- 3 MP - Range: Line of Effect. You can suck the Vitality out of living things. This spell removes up to 6 Vitality from the target and gives 1/3 of it to you.<br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Animate Object</span></strong></span></span>- 4 MP - You can force Vitality into inanimate objects, things that were never alive to begin with. It seems to be more complicated than Zombification though- your Rock doesn&#039;t do anything, which is hardly useful. You&#039;ll need to experiment with this more.<br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Alter Golem</span></strong></span></span>- 2 MP- You can make basic alterations to an existing construct or animated object.<br /><br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Planned Experiments</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">-This one&#039;s a bit morbid, but bear with me. Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- Test Command Undead by commanding something you&#039;ve raised to self-terminate.&nbsp; &nbsp;A further test of this would be if it could work on the undead that other necromancers have summoned.<br />- Test Command Undead, and see if can you over-ride commands given to a zombie summoned by another necromancer.&nbsp; Does the zombie respond to the most recent order given, or does it have loyalty to whomever summoned it?&nbsp; Or maybe it is under the control of the more powerful of the two necromancers.<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />- Steal Vitality on self<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8.

I&#039;m not going to win (currently at 26k) though I have enough written I think I will finish the book- my current goal is to get it done by the new year.<br /><br />Anyway, enough about me and the things I do instead of this awesome game- on with the story!<br /></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3690505#msg3690505">Quote from: Grek on Sat 13-10-2012, 01:46:54</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I would advise against stalling.

With a tired groan, you roll over in bed- although your other dreams are rapidly dissipating, your encounter with Fale Packunion remains sharp and clear. There is no doubt in your mind that he (or she, or it) is no figment of your imagination.<br /><br />Judging by the weak light attempting to crawl in the window, it is either early morning or quite cloudy outside. After rubbing your eyes, you conclude you won&#039;t be able to get back to sleep. In the interests of fairness, you decide Omo should get up as well- sitting up, you dig through your pack for <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em>. Close inspection confirms that it is a sturdy, well crafted tome. Reassured that the book will be fine, you toss it off the foot of the bed, about where you judge Omo&#039;s head to be.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Agh! Wha- Did you just throw the book at me, Nym?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yeah. I had a weird dream last night.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So you chucked your textbook at my head!?! You could&#039;ve brained me!&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It&#039;s not like you were using those brains anyway.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;On the contrary, those brains are giving me a nice pounding headache to thank me for the ale I had last night. I was rather hoping we&#039;d get to sleep in before we go tramping through the wilderness.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Sorry, no such luck. Listen- the dream I had wasn&#039;t really a dream, I think. Somehow, some other Necromancer contacted me in my sleep.&quot;</span><br />Omo sits bolt upright before wincing and rubbing his head. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Wait, what? Necromancers can do that?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I guess? He said his name was Fale Packunion.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Strange name- sounds vaguely dwarven.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yeah. He appeared to be an elf though- actually first he appeared to be a human woman, then changed to an elf man. He said he was trying to unify the Necromancers under Morka, god of Death. Ever hear of him?&quot;</span><br />Omo shakes his head. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;No, I&#039;ve never heard of Morka. I know the Golgothans worshiped Golgoth, but they&#039;re all dead now.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Wait, really? I didn&#039;t know that.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yeah, well, you&#039;d have known if you had paid more attention to the Sages. That&#039;s pretty much all I remember, though. What happened next?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;He said something about teaching me Necromancy in exchange for my allegiance, and everyone I love will betray me, yadda yadda so on and so forth. I turned him down- I know he&#039;s definitely working with Nightroar, and any friend of his is no friend of mine.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Right. So... what now?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I don&#039;t think he knows I&#039;ve left the Vale- he kept asking where I was, like he didn&#039;t know. I don&#039;t know if anything has really changed for us- we know the other Necromancers are working together to conquer the world, but not much else at this point. I say we go on like before. If we leave now, we should make Aloclesno before nightfall.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yeah... that makes sense, I guess. Let&#039;s get some breakfast first, though.&quot;</span><br /><br />After taking advantage of the opportunity to freshen up, you head downstairs. The common room is empty except for the sleepy innkeeper, who stifles a yawn as he brings you a bowl of oatmeal with some dried fruit slices on top. Omo begins to devour his portion with single-minded determination.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So do you know which way we&#039;re going?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Mmmph. Yeah, I was talking with the soldiers about it last night. There&#039;s a dirt road that should take us straight to the forest, more or less. There&#039;s a few flyspeck farming villages between here and there- most are abandoned, but the one furthest south is still inhabited.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;The village closest to the forest?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Mmhm. Patrols head that way every now and again to make sure they&#039;re alright, but they haven&#039;t seen much in the way of zombies- too far out of the way, likely. We should be able to spend the night there before going on into the forest.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Wait, you didn&#039;t tell them we were going into the haunted forest, did you?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Please, give me <em>some</em> credit. If anyone asks, we&#039;re looking for family from one of the abandoned villages.&quot;</span><br /><br />After breakfast, you gather your things and hit the road. As it turns out, it is indeed both early in the morning and quite cloudy out. A warm southerly breeze promises rain as it tugs at your cloak and stirs the flags of the Imperial troopers. There is a general exodus in progress as most of the soldiers gear up and head out on patrol, while the remainder continue their efforts at fortifying the village. Leaving through the East Gate, Omo quickly peels away from the marching warriors and takes you down a narrow dirt road.<br /><br />It is something of a kindness to call it a road- more accurately, it is a set of wagon-wheel ruts straddling a strip of dirt hard-packed from generations of traveling feet. Hardy weeds stubbornly eke out an existence on the otherwise barren path. The road zigs and zags its way through the farmland near the village, but once out in the open spaces it straightens up quite nicely. It also deteriorates somewhat- clearly, not many travelers leave the highway to visit the boondocks.<br /><br />For the most part, the road leads through uninhabited wilderness, grassland broken only by the odd bush or shrub. Every once in a great while, you pass a solitary farm- some are abandoned, their windows boarded shut and occupants fled, but many of the farmers stubborn enough to scrape an existence this far from civilization are also stubborn enough to remain in their homes despite the Necromancer threat. Their life appears largely unchanged as they work the fields, getting the first crops of the season planted.<br /><br />As Omo mentioned, there are indeed small hamlets out here, little more than a half dozen stone farmhouses clustered around a good source of water, with maybe an inn or some craftsman&#039;s shop. The grey clouds begin to drizzle on you as you pass through the first hamlet, but by the time you&#039;ve passed the last villager returning from his field the rain has stopped. When you pass through the second hamlet early in the afternoon, however, there are no villagers to pass- every home and shop is boarded up, abandoned. There is something profoundly unsettling about a completely deserted village- rather than take your lunch there, you continue on a ways out of town.<br /><br />The drizzle makes a serious attempt to qualify as rain as you continue following the road southeast, but ultimately peters out after about an hour of dampness. The farmhouses become few and far between as the land gets more and more rough, the monotony of the countryside now broken up with the occasional boulder. The road becomes less a road and more of a trail as the grass and weeds grow over the wagon tracks, making footing difficult. It&#039;s a very boring afternoon of walking- Omo seems to be alone with his thoughts, and you find your own thoughts returning to your strange dream, searching for clues. You&#039;ve never heard of Necromancy being associated with dreams in any story, but then again, you&#039;ve also never heard of them being associated with golems, either. <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> makes no mention of dreams or dream magic for any of the other Magical Faiths. Really, the only dream magic you&#039;ve heard of comes from fairy tales which have no basis in fact.<br /><br />The sun hangs low in the sky when you begin passing farmhouses again. Though they appear to be deserted, they do not appear to have been abandoned for long- children&#039;s toys and farming implements still litter the ground, and at one farm you see a small herd of cattle still within their pen. Looking around, you see no farmers- your shouts elicit no response from the locked and hastily boarded up farmhouse.<br /><br />The village comes into view after another couple miles of walking. It is clearly larger than the hamlets you passed on the road here. Not only are there more houses, but a prominent two story building rising up in the middle of town appears to be a temple. You hear plenty of commotion, but encounter no villagers until you stand in the center of town. Beside the temple is an open, grassy area- or rather, it would be open if it were not full of villagers standing around, talking anxiously. Other villagers hurry in and out of the temple, running off on whatever errand is important enough to take precedence over dinnertime. Looking further down the road, you can see a large, loud man directing a line of villagers shoveling dirt, digging a trench to the east of the village.<br /><br />Omo scratches his head, looking at all the activity. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, I don&#039;t see anyplace that looks like an inn.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- Test Command Undead by commanding something you&#039;ve raised to self-terminate.&nbsp; &nbsp;A further test of this would be if it could work on the undead that other necromancers have summoned.<br />- Test Command Undead, and see if can you over-ride commands given to a zombie summoned by another necromancer.&nbsp; Does the zombie respond to the most recent order given, or does it have loyalty to whomever summoned it?&nbsp; Or maybe it is under the control of the more powerful of the two necromancers.<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />- Steal Vitality on self<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8.

Get some information about the whole deal, try to discover what exactly is going on and if they expect to be attacked in less than a day. If so, we should consider carrying on to somewhere else, even if we don&#039;t get to sleep. If they are to be attacked we can&#039;t really make any difference or be of any help except possibly by using necromancy itself, which not only is not even close of being certain to help, can easily lead on to the villagers turning onto us and getting the word out of us as a necromancer. That would suck. Hard. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />After looking around for a moment, you decide to take the direct approach and ask one of the nearby villagers what is going on. Seeing an older man standing by himself, you walk over to introduce yourself.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Hello! What&#039;s all the commotion?&quot;</span><br />He regards you in surprise, stroking his chin. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>&quot;Haven&#039;t you heard? Zombies attacked some of the outlying farms last night! We&#039;re waiting to hear what happened- some folks are still missing, and we don&#039;t know if the village is in danger.&quot;</strong></span> His eyes narrow as he examines you more closely. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>&quot;You aren&#039;t from around here, are you? Who are you?&quot;</strong></span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We&#039;re looking for relatives from ours- they would have been from a nearby villager.&quot;</span> Omo interjects quickly.<br />The man shakes his head. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>&quot;I can&#039;t say as we&#039;ve had any refugees come our way- most of them are running back toward the city. I had friends in Stickover, though- looking for anyone I know?&quot;</strong></span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Uh...&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Revereorder. Luki Revereorder, would be the head of the family.&quot;</span><br />The man scratches his chin. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>&quot;Never heard of him, but then again, I don&#039;t get out of Bedscaled very often these days. I don&#039;t know of anyone else coming here, but you could ask Eko Cleanvise- he&#039;s the priest here.&quot;</strong></span> He spit off to the side, grimacing sourly. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>&quot;Not much of a priest, but he&#039;s all we got.&quot;</strong></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Not much of a priest?&quot;</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>&quot;He&#039;s never been the most pious man, but he&#039;s always got the job done- before now. Rumors are going around that several of the farmhouses that were destroyed were ones near Aloclesno- farmhouses that were supposed to be warded against the undead!&quot;</strong></span><br /><br />Interested to hear him mention Aloclesno, you begin to question him further, but a sudden shout from the front of the crowd draws your attention. Waving for attention atop the temple steps stands a heavyset balding man wearing a coarse brown robe. Hanging around his neck is a medallion, a simple iron square divided into four even quadrants. You recognize the symbol from the religious motifs you saw at the Temple of Larathor. The crowd huddles around him, calling for attention.<br /><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: teal;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What&#039;s the word, Eko?&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What&#039;s happened to the Scarletdaubs?&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Where are the zombies? Are we safe here?&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Why didn&#039;t your wards work, Eko?&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;That&#039;s enough! Quiet down so I can tell you right!&quot;</span></span> the priest shouted in a deep, gravelly voice, holding his arms up. After a moment, the crowd quieted enough for him to continue. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Here&#039;s what we know. Last night, a large force of the undead struck four farmhouses to the east. The Trimsockets and the Overblushes managed to escape, and made their way back here to warn the rest of us. The Drunkenstumbles fought with what weapons they had, and drove the zombies off. Jal and Zego were killed, though, and Ado is in a bad way. The Scarletdaubs fought too, but they were overcome. We found Cikul&#039;s body mangled in the house, but everyone else is missing.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Where did they come from?&quot;</span></span> a worried voice called out.<br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Somewhere to the east. We don&#039;t know more than that, however- we found bloody, child-sized footprints outside the Scarletdaubs farmstead, and there is a search on to see whether the kids might have escaped the attack.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">&quot;How come they could even attack the Scarletdaub place?&quot;</span></span> another angry voice shouted. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">&quot;They&#039;re right by the forest! You were supposed to have warded them from zombies!&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;If I knew, I&#039;d tell you.&quot;</span></span> Eko said curtly. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;All we know is that somehow, they can overcome the wards. I urge everyone to stay within the village until we know more. It doesn&#039;t seem likely that we&#039;ll be attacked again, but we will have a watch kept throughout the night. If you have nowhere to sleep, the Temple of Atal is open to all. We have already sent a rider to inform the Imperial Forces of our situation- all that can be done has been done! Either help with the defenses, or return to your homes!&quot;</span></span><br /><br />Ignoring further calls for his attention, Eko steps back inside the temple, shutting the door behind himself. A couple villagers, undeterred, follow him inside. A half dozen men and women walk down the road to where the ditch is being dug, determined to help out. Most of the crowd, however, disperses to their homes, muttering uneasily to one another.<br /><br />Rubbing your arm, you consider the situation thoughtfully. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What do you think, Omo? I don&#039;t think we can be much help here, and the Imperials should come soon enough. Maybe we should go the long way around the forest.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Maybe.&quot;</span> Omo says, his voice grave. He slings his quarterstaff behind his shoulders, pensively holding it between his wrists and the back of his neck.<br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Maybe?&quot;</span> You quirk an eyebrow. <br />Omo stand with his head down for a moment, then nods. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;He said they think the kids from that farm survived. Do you think any of these farmers can track as well as an Elven Ranger?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You want to help them find the survivors?&quot;</span><br />Omo nods again, more firmly. He lazily twirls his staff before grounding it in the dirt. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;A Ranger like me? I won&#039;t even be gone the whole night.&quot;</span><br /><br />You consider Omo&#039;s plan. It has its merits- he&#039;s probably right that a trained woodsman will stand a better chance of finding the missing humans, and it&#039;s not like you&#039;re on a tight schedule. On the other hand, you aren&#039;t sure where this would leave you- should you stay behind in the village, and try to learn more about Aloclesno and the priest&#039;s wards against the undead? Or should you accompany Omo? If he runs into zombie trouble, your presence could be a great help. Then again, maybe you should just leave the humans to their own devices, and set off immediately- there are bigger forces loose in the world, and time spent here is less time spent harnessing your powers.<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 11/11<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 12/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 20/35<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">80 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Headband, Belt Knife, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr>, <abbr title="See detailed workings of Necromancy">Improved Necromantic Sight(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr>, <abbr title="can swim in calm, peaceful waters">Dabbling Swimmer</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Tired<br /><strong>Twenty</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - Detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - Causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - You can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><strong>Waterproof</strong>- 1MP/Hour duration - Makes an object non-absorbent.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- Test Command Undead by commanding something you&#039;ve raised to self-terminate.&nbsp; &nbsp;A further test of this would be if it could work on the undead that other necromancers have summoned.<br />- Test Command Undead, and see if can you over-ride commands given to a zombie summoned by another necromancer.&nbsp; Does the zombie respond to the most recent order given, or does it have loyalty to whomever summoned it?&nbsp; Or maybe it is under the control of the more powerful of the two necromancers.<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />- Steal Vitality on self<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8.

Either we search now or we don&#039;t search at all.

He lazily twirls his staff before grounding it in the dirt. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;A Ranger like me? I won&#039;t even be gone the whole night.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Hm. Alright, then. But I&#039;m going with you.&quot;</span><br />Omo gives you a surprised look. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Really? I figured you would want to stay here for the night to rest and eat. Since when can you track?&quot;</span><br />You lower your voice. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It&#039;s not the kids I&quot;ll be tracking. If there are undead out there, you&#039;ll need my talents.&quot;</span> You raise your voice, giving Omo a joking grin. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Besides, I may not have paid attention to the history lessons, but I did pay attention to the adventure stories! Nothing good ever happens when the heroes split up.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Ha! Alright then, let&#039;s ask Mr. Eko about the search.&quot;</span><br /><br />Just as Omo speaks his name, the doors to the temple burst open as the aforementioned priest ushers a loudly protesting villager outside. Eko Cleanvise gives the man one last shove down the street, pointing toward the line of digging villagers- the villager hesitates a moment before sullenly walking away, muttering under his breath as he goes to join the workers. Eko sighs, shaking his head before turning to go back inside. Omo, seeing his opportunity, quickly strides up to the portly priest.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Hello! Eko Cleanvise!&quot;</span><br />Eko glowers as he turns to face you. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Listen, I don&#039;t know why the wards failed, but I&#039;m doing my best to find out. Leave me be, I have an injured man to tend to!&quot;</span></span><br />Omo holds up his hands. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;No, no, I don&#039;t care about that. My name is Omo, and this is Nym.&quot;</span><br />You give Eko a small wave. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Actually, I would like to hear an answer about the wards, but my interest is purely academic.&quot;</span><br />Eko blinks, taking in your appearance. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Eh? I didn&#039;t expect to see strangers in the village- we don&#039;t get many travelers to begin with, and these are dark times to be on the open road. Well, if you need shelter for the night, you are more than welcome to stay in my temple. I can&#039;t promise terribly good accommodations, but blankets by the fire are still better than a cold shrub by the roadside.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Actually, we heard about your troubles, and the missing children, and we&#039;d like to volunteer for the search.&quot;</span> Omo draws himself up proudly. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I&#039;m an expert tracker, better than anyone for miles around!&quot;</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I appreciate your offer, but the last I&#039;ve heard you won&#039;t be able to track anything. The rain has obscured what few tracks remained, and by the time you got out to the farm the sun will have set.&quot;</span></span> Eko sighs heavily. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We&#039;ll be happy to have your help tomorrow, but two small children, alone in the wilderness, surrounded by zombies, possibly injured... well, I don&#039;t have to tell you the odds are bad.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;How old are the children?&quot;</span> You ask gently.<br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We aren&#039;t sure- the zombies didn&#039;t leave any bodies at the farmhouse except for poor Cikul, and the last I heard they&#039;d only found sign of two children. Based on the footprints we found we think that the two youngest escaped- Nelti is a six year old girl, and Rismal is an eight year old boy.&quot;</span></span><br />Omo raises one finger, smiling broadly. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I wasn&#039;t kidding when I said I&#039;m the best tracker around- I don&#039;t care about the rain, and I don&#039;t care about the dark! The trail will only get colder overnight.&quot;</span><br />Eko regards the ranger gravely. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;And the zombies? I&#039;m sure the searchers are abandoning the hunt as we speak- they aren&#039;t likely to succeed where they&#039;ve failed all day, and there&#039;s no need to get even more people killed by the undead threat.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We are aware of the danger, Mr. Eko, and we&#039;re willing to search anyway. Can you give us directions to the Scarletdaub farm?&quot;</span><br />Eko sighs. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, don&#039;t say I didn&#039;t warn you. The Scarletdaub farm is easy to find- just follow the road East, out of the village. It&#039;s the last farm on the path, within sight of Aloclesno itself- Cikul was always a brave man, willing to farm and prosper where others feared to tread. The searchers said they found the footprints by the well. Just be careful out there, and don&#039;t do anything stupid- I&#039;ll have a spot by the fire waiting for you.&quot;</span></span><br /><br />Making your farewells, you and Omo set out down the road to the Scarletdaub farm. Passing the line of villagers, you see that they aren&#039;t merely digging a ditch, they are also building an earthen wall to defend the village. You attract a few odd looks, but pass the workers unmolested.<br /><br />The setting sun at your back casts long shadows before you as you continue down the road. Though there are plenty of farms nestled close to the village, they peter out after a mile or so- evidently, the land East of the village is not as highly prized as that to the West. A dark shadow growing on the horizon slowly resolves itself into a distant forest- Aloclesno, no doubt. Although the sun is only now dipping below the horizon, the moon is well on its way into the sky, shining down on the darkening landscape.<br /><br />Twilight is giving way to full night by the time the shadowy hulk of a farmhouse looms out of the dark. The farmhouse itself sits fairly close to the road- to the right, the animal pens stand open and empty of livestock. Further back, you can see the tall wooden barn standing between the farmyard and the fields. The whole place is eerily quiet, with only the gentle breeze occasionally rustling the grass.<br /><br />Omo points to the well, walking to where it is situated between the barn and the house. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Eko said they found the footprints there, so that&#039;s where we&#039;ll start.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Do you want me to light a torch?&quot;</span><br />Omo crouches down by the side of the well, inspecting the ground. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;No, we need to preserve our night vision. Besides, I don&#039;t want to give away our position if there are any zombies out.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Can zombies see torchlight?&quot;</span><br />Omo gives you a startled glance. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I- what are you asking me for? You&#039;re the, uh, the one who should know.&quot;</span><br />You shrug. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I haven&#039;t raised anything bigger than a fish. Actually, I think they can see the torchlight, but I don&#039;t know if they&#039;re smart enough to know to attack it.&quot;</span><br />Omo grunts, slowly walking around the well. He stops, pointing at the ground. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Here. Two barefoot children were here, one bigger than the other.&quot;</span> He touches the ground. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Still a little blood. These are the tracks.&quot;</span><br />You follow Omo as he slowly walks away from the well, following signs only he can see. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Is it their blood, do you think?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Impossible to tell. One of them was either bleeding or dripping blood, though.&quot;</span> Omo scowls at the ground. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Stupid farmers, trampling my tracks.&quot;</span> Omo&#039;s scowl deepened as he neared the edge of the farmyard. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;They were being followed.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Followed?&quot;</span><br />Omo nods. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;A few larger creatures were right behind them- that&#039;s why the tracks are so difficult to find. I&#039;m guessing they were being chased by zombies.&quot;</span><br /><br />Omo slowly follows the tracks away from the farmyard- rather than turning toward the cleared fields or the open road, the tracks go straight into the wilderness. Omo moves more quickly in the tall grass, pointing out broken shrubs and trampled weeds that clearly mark the passage of something large. Every now and then, Omo pauses to examine a small piece of cloth caught on a thorny bush, or a shallow, bare footprint softened by the day&#039;s drizzle- evidence that the missing children had indeed come this way.<br /><br />Suddenly, you sense something. You reach out and grab Omo&#039;s arm. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Get down!&quot;</span> you hiss.<br />Omo immediately crouches down below the grass, quickly looking around. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What is it?&quot;</span> he whispers.<br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Undead.&quot;</span> You point ahead, somewhat away from the bearing of the path. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Two of them. No, three, maybe eighty feet ahead. Four vitality each.&quot;</span><br />Omo squints ahead. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;That&#039;s nearly in the forest.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;That&#039;s where the trail is leading, too. Do you think the kids would run into the haunted forest?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;If they thought the zombies wouldn&#039;t follow. Or maybe they just thought it would be easier to hide in the trees than out here in the grass.&quot;</span><br /><br />Now that you know where to look, you can see faint pinpoints of purple light flashing in the distance. They appear stand just short of the treeline- there is an unusually clear edge to the forest, with open plain giving way to ancient, dense forest in the space of a half dozen yards. The surrounding plain is the same thigh-high grass interspersed with taller shrubs that you&#039;ve been traveling through all day.<br /><br />Omo wipes his hands on his pants before hefting his quarterstaff. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;The Rangers say that most zombies are slow and flimsy. Easy to defeat if you don&#039;t get spooked. We need to get by them to follow the trail- should we fight, or do you have a better idea?&quot;</span><br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 11/11<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 12/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 20/35<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">80 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Headband, Belt Knife, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr>, <abbr title="See detailed workings of Necromancy">Improved Necromantic Sight(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr>, <abbr title="can swim in calm, peaceful waters">Dabbling Swimmer</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Alert<br /><strong>Twenty</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - Detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - Causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - You can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><strong>Waterproof</strong>- 1MP/Hour duration - Makes an object non-absorbent.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- Test Command Undead by commanding something you&#039;ve raised to self-terminate.&nbsp; &nbsp;A further test of this would be if it could work on the undead that other necromancers have summoned.<br />- Test Command Undead, and see if can you over-ride commands given to a zombie summoned by another necromancer.&nbsp; Does the zombie respond to the most recent order given, or does it have loyalty to whomever summoned it?&nbsp; Or maybe it is under the control of the more powerful of the two necromancers.<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />- Steal Vitality on self<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Northwest Thrimesdur<br /><a href="http://tnypic.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

I thought you were going to magic them.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I am.&quot;</span> You take the proffered <abbr title="1d6 damage, Slashing">hatchet</abbr>, hefting it. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I&#039;m going to try and unmake them, if I can.

You quickly give up the endeavor as fruitless, however- they are at the extreme edge of your Necromantic Sight, and you simply cannot see them well enough to manipulate the way you want to. You need to be closer.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;They&#039;re too far away. Help me sneak up on them.&quot;</span><br /><br />Omo nods wordlessly, and begins to slowly creep through the grass. <abbr title="(6)+2(Ambusher) = 8">...</abbr> Omo carefully picks his way past thorny shrubs and hidden gopher holes, guiding you toward the zombies sixty feet away. Fifty feet. Forty.<br /><br />When you are about thirty feet away, you put a hand on Omo&#039;s back, signalling him to stop. <abbr title="Hidden Observer Roll">...</abbr> The moon rising beyond the forest casts deep shadows beneath the trees, the zombies illuminated only by the purple flame that dances in their eyes. You can see them clearly now that you are closer- in life, they were likely peasants, and they still wear their ragged tunics and stained pants. Your stomach turns at the stench of rotten meat. One zombie is missing an arm, a milky white shard of bone jutting out of the stump. The zombies have no weapons, and appear to be doing nothing more than standing idly, occasionally turning to face a new direction.<br /><br />From here, you can see the shape of the necromantic energy in their bodies, if not the finer details. A great deal of it seems to be concentrated in the head, flowing down the spine and splitting off into the arms and legs. To your eyes, it&#039;s rather like being able to see the strings and sticks that move a puppet. Extending your will, you concentrate on the head of the nearest zombie- it appears to be the most important part of the zombie, and possibly the key to unraveling the undead. You can almost feel the necromantic energy there, with it&#039;s smooth, glassy texture. Suddenly, you find purchase, and you deftly begin to pull, attempting to unravel the fabric of the-<br /><br /><abbr title="2MP"><strong><span style="font-size: 16pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Impair Undead</span></span></span></strong></abbr><br /><br />You blink as the zombie&#039;s eyes flash once, then wink out. Immediately, the zombie throws its arms out and staggers around briefly before promptly tripping over a shrub. More worryingly, both the one-armed zombie and the third, furthest zombie turn toward the bush where you and Omo are hidden and begin purposely striding over to you.<br /><br />Shouting wordlessly, Omo springs from your hiding place and charges toward the zombies, <abbr title="(4) +2(Skill) +1(Equipment) +1(Charge) vs (7)">...</abbr> thrusting one end of his quarterstaff squarely into the one-armed zombie&#039;s chest. <abbr title="(2) damage">...</abbr> The zombie stumbles back from the force of the blow, but remains standing.<br /><br />Acting quickly, you cast <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Command Undead</span></strong></span></span> on the zombie behind it and experience the familiar moment of vertigo as your consciousness floods the zombie. You become aware of everything the zombie is feeling- its joints and muscles are stiff and resist movement, its left leg is quite deteriorated as the rot has nearly reached the bone, and the zombie retains an impetus to find and kill human figures. Much like the crayfish what seems so long ago, you easily override its old actions and direct it to strike at the one-armed zombie reeling from Omo&#039;s blow.&nbsp; <abbr title="(10) +1(Backstab) vs (12)">...</abbr> Your zombie swipes at the target with one hand, but misses as the enemy once again moves toward Omo.<br /><br />The one-armed zombie rears back before swinging wildly at Omo,&nbsp; <abbr title="(10) vs (1) +2(Skill)">...</abbr> effortlessly smashing the staff from the elf&#039;s hands. <abbr title="(1) damage">...</abbr> The cold hand of the zombie scratches a furrow down Omo&#039;s arm as the elf dances back, cursing. Desperately, you direct your zombie to attack before One-arm can follow up its advantage, <abbr title="(1) +1(Backstab) vs (1)">...</abbr> <abbr title="(4) damage">...</abbr> and this time the clumsy swing crashes into the side of the one-armed zombie&#039;s skull with a wet thud. One-arm collapses, the lights in its eyes winking out and the necromantic energy that animated the body dispersing.<br /><br />Omo curses as the first zombie regains its feet, flailing around blindly. Scooping up his staff, Omo runs up to the impaired zombie <abbr title="(12)">...</abbr> and swings his staff like an overlong club, crushing the zombie&#039;s knee. <abbr title="(2) damage">...</abbr> The blind zombie collapses once again, its leg twisting uselessly under it. Before Omo can wind up to deliver the killing blow, your minion arrives and awkwardly kicks at the prone zombie, <abbr title="(3) +1(Backstab) vs (2) -3(Blinded)">...</abbr> connecting with the chest <abbr title="(3) damage">...</abbr> and cracking its ribs. The zombie convulses once before lying still, dead once more.<br /><br />Breathing heavily, Omo shouts happily. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Ha! Yes! There, that wasn&#039;t so hard.&quot;</span><br />You let out a breath you didn&#039;t know you were holding. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Are you alright?&quot;</span><br />Omo&#039;s grin turns to a grimace as he examines his arm. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yeah, it&#039;s just a scratch. It smarts, but it&#039;s not too bad. I just underestimated how hard those things can punch.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Please try to hold onto your weapon in the future, you just about gave me a heart attack.&quot;</span><br />Omo ignores you, looking around on the ground. Walking over to where the zombies had been clustered, he crouched down before grunting to himself. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well. The tracks of the children definitely run into the woods. For whatever reason, those three zombies stopped short of the forest. I wonder how long they&#039;ve been standing here.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Are you sure they&#039;re the same zombies?&quot;</span><br />Omo shrugs. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Sure enough. I don&#039;t see anything to suggest otherwise, and it&#039;d be a pretty big coincidence that three other zombies happened to wander to the exact location those kids ran into the forest. The question is, what do we do now?&quot;</span><br /><br />You shiver in the cold night breeze, eying the forest with distaste. It&#039;s quite dark in the thick growth beneath the branches, and you never did get a chance to ask about those rumors that the forest is haunted in some way. It&#039;s one thing to go searching for missing children, it&#039;s quite another to do so in the middle of the night in a cursed forest. Then again, you now know that the kids weren&#039;t caught by the zombies- it&#039;s quite possible that they are still alive, lost somewhere in that same forest. And speaking of zombies, you should probably do something about the one you&#039;re commanding.<br /><br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 11/11<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 8/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 23/35<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">80 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Headband, Belt Knife, <abbr title="1d6 damage, Slashing">Hatchet</abbr>, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr>, <abbr title="See detailed workings of Necromancy">Improved Necromantic Sight(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr>, <abbr title="can swim in calm, peaceful waters">Dabbling Swimmer</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Commanding a Zombie Human<br /><strong>Twenty and a half</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - Detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - Causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - You can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><strong>Waterproof</strong>- 1MP/Hour duration - Makes an object non-absorbent.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />- Steal Vitality on self<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br />- Trying to develop a destroy vitality spell, using the same principles of the steal vitality, except without keeping it usable. It might be possible to do it for cheaper or causing more damage for the same mana.<br />- Trying to use the principles of the destroy vitality or the steal vitality spell for a disinfectant spell. It will require a lot of fine control, but it should theoretically be possible.<br />- We could also try to overbuff a zombie. Is there a max to the amount of vitality a zombie can have? And what happens if a zombie gets a lot of vitality?<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Northwest Thrimesdur<br /><a href="http://tnypic.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

You do see a fair bit of mud in the wound, though, and a brief glance at your controlled zombie&#039;s hands confirm that not only are they filthy, they are partially rotten. Taking the waterskin from Omo&#039;s pack, you carefully clean out the scratches before improvising a bandage out of a clean pair of socks.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Would you cut that out, Nym!

The Necromantic Energy making up the zombie you&#039;ve commanded is quite intricate. Whether this is due to the skill of the Necromancer, the quality of the base corpse, or your own improved Necromantic Sight is unclear- you&#039;ll have to raise some more zombies for comparison purposes. In life, the zombie was probably a middle-aged man. It&#039;s difficult to tell more than that, as much of the creature&#039;s flesh is rotten and bloated. The left leg is especially rotten, and upon closer inspection appears to have been mangled rather thoroughly.<br /><br />With a thought, you direct the zombie to begin walking into the forest. Omo steps back in surprise. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What is it doing?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I&#039;m sending it into the forest. I want to know if there&#039;s some reas...on...&quot;</span> Your mouth hangs open, astonished. As the zombie steps beneath the branches of the forest, it disappears from your Necromantic Sight.<br /><br />Hastily, you command it to stop walking- you are still in direct mental contact. You can see the zombie obediently standing in front of a tree, but you cannot see the Necromantic Energy that animates it. You quickly review the zombie&#039;s status- it seems unharmed. Completely unchanged, in fact. Commanding it to turn around, you are again surprised by what the zombie sees- namely, nothing. You and Omo are invisible as far as the zombie is concerned, although it can still see the rock Omo is leaning against and the tall grass that rustles in the cold night breeze.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It couldn&#039;t see them.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;That&#039;s why the zombies didn&#039;t chase the kids any further. Once they got under the trees, the zombies couldn&#039;t see them, so they stopped chasing them.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;And just stood around all day?&quot;</span> Omo says doubtfully.<br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I guess.&quot;</span> You shrug. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Let me check this quick.&quot;</span><br /><br />A quick experiment confirms your suspicions- when you swap places with your zombie, you remain invisible to the zombie&#039;s sense. Waving Omo to join you, you watch through the zombie&#039;s eyes as the elf disappears between one step and the next, right at the edge of the trees.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So what does it mean? Why can&#039;t it see what&#039;s in the forest?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I don&#039;t know. It just can&#039;t.&quot;</span><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3853244#msg3853244">Quote from: Felius on Thu 06-12-2012, 14:52:39</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Oh well, destroy the commanded zombie, and keep looking for the kids.

Right now a hatchet to the head should be better. Order it not to move nor resist. That, or order it to bash itself on the head.

Lovely.&quot;</span> Omo hefts his quarterstaff, eying the zombie, then swings it over his head like a great club. The zombie&#039;s skull bursts like a rotten watermelon, splashing bits of grey matter and blood everywhere. Your stomach turns uneasily, and Omo glowers at the end of his staff, trying to wipe off the bloody mess in the dirt. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;This Necromancy stuff is gross.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Did I ever tell you about the fish I swallowed?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;...no?&quot;</span> <br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I&#039;ll tell you later, when my stomach isn&#039;t so queasy. Let&#039;s get on with it.&quot;</span><br /><br />Omo quickly picks up the trail, leading the way into the forest. The ancient, gnarled trees stand tightly packed, choking away the undergrowth until all that remains is a carpet of dead leaves and fallen branches. The thick branches block all but the rarest shaft of moonlight. Omo is forced to give in to necessity and lights a torch, the light casting sinister shadows on the trees. You&#039;ve never seen a malicious tree, but these come close, clawing past one another to reach the far away light- they seem to glower at passersby.<br /><br />Despite the open space beneath the trees, the going is slow. The trail zigs and zags abruptly, and even crosses over itself once. The poor lighting helps disguise the trail in several places, where the children jumped over a log and changed direction, or where they doubled back after running headlong into a tree. Omo mutters angrily under his breath, suspiciously eying the shadows and rubbing his quarterstaff before returning to the search. The forest is quiet- perfectly silent except for the sound of your passage.<br /><br />Finally, the trail leads into a small clearing. There is nothing to suggest why this particular bit of forest is free of the tall trees- the ground appears to be smooth and flat here, and clear enough for grass and weeds to push through the dead leaves. In the center of the clearing a pair of young trees rise out of the ground, vying with one another to reach the canopy and the life-giving light beyond. The open space in the canopy admits a wide swath of moonlight which clearly illuminates everything in the clearing.<br /><br />Most notably, it illuminates the small child lying motionless on the ground, face down in the dirt.<br /><br />Omo runs to the child, peering suspiciously into the shadows before kneeling beside the pajama-clad form. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;He&#039;s alive!&quot;</span> Omo calls back softly, checking the boy.<br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;He&#039;s alive?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yeah. Unconscious.&quot;</span> Omo rolls the boy over, and you blink in surprise. The boy&#039;s eyes are open, staring at the sky. Omo wipes a dead leaf away from his face before checking his pulse. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well. I don&#039;t know what&#039;s wrong with him.&quot;</span> <br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Are you sure he&#039;s unconscious? I didn&#039;t think your eyes stayed open when you went out.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What do I look like, a doctor? He&#039;s unresponsive, anyway.&quot;</span> Omo gets to his feet, inspecting the trail.<br /><br />You take the boy in your arms, giving him a gentle shake. His head lolls to the side, but his eyes don&#039;t change. His heartbeat is fine, his breathing regular. He&#039;s quite cold- not like a corpse is cold, but like somebody who has been out in the elements too long is cold. Carefully, you bundle him in your cloak, unsure what to do.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Nym! I found the girl!&quot;</span><br /><br />You look up as Omo returns from the edge of the clearing, carrying the child. Following your example, he wraps her in his cloak- just like her brother, the girl is physically fine, but unresponsive, her unseeing eyes gazing at nothing.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;This is bloody strange.&quot;</span> Omo grumbles.<br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What is?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;As near as I can tell, the kids were just walking along, then fell. No other tracks nearby, no roots to trip on. They entered the clearing together, then the boy fell here in the middle, then the girl fell while she was running away. I think they&#039;ve been lying here all day, Nym.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;They&#039;re certainly cold enough. How long does it take to die of exposure?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;The weather&#039;s not bad, but it still gets plenty cold at night this early in the year. I doubt they&#039;d have made it to dawn. I don&#039;t know if they&#039;ll make it back to the village, if they&#039;re catatonic.&quot;</span><br /><br />The kids are in a bad way- you don&#039;t know what&#039;s wrong with them, but they need medical attention. This whole situation stinks.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />- Steal Vitality on self<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br />- Trying to develop a destroy vitality spell, using the same principles of the steal vitality, except without keeping it usable. It might be possible to do it for cheaper or causing more damage for the same mana.<br />- Trying to use the principles of the destroy vitality or the steal vitality spell for a disinfectant spell. It will require a lot of fine control, but it should theoretically be possible.<br />- We could also try to overbuff a zombie. Is there a max to the amount of vitality a zombie can have? And what happens if a zombie gets a lot of vitality?<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Northwest Thrimesdur<br /><a href="http://tnypic.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

So let&#039;s carry them back to the village. Do we have any spell in the prestidigitation book that might help? <br /><br />Hmm, it probably is a waste of mana, but cast detect vitality and detect magic on them, plus examine them for signs of necromantic magic. It might tell us if there&#039;s anything wrong with them other than shock and physical illness. It&#039;s a bit of paranoia, but as Omo said, the situation looked quite strange. But either way, considering that, it&#039;s probably better if we don&#039;t take too long around here.<br /><br />And on another note, we should run some experiments later to figure out if it&#039;s something about this particular forest, something about forest in general (unlikely, we&#039;d have noticed it before), or the anti-necromancy wards the village mentioned. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3873171#msg3873171">Quote from: Cellmonk on Fri 14-12-2012, 05:12:05</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yeah, seems pretty clear.

Something is very wrong here. We need to get out of this forest as soon as possible.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You said it. I wish there was more we could do for them, but the priest is probably better equipped for healing than we are.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You remember your magic lessons, right Omo? Cast Sense Vitality on the kids.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What, <em>you </em>don&#039;t remember? I thought you were the magic-type person here!&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Don&#039;t be stupid- I want to conserve my Mana in case we run into something nasty. If the kids are in really bad shape, I think I have a way to help them.&quot;</span><br />Omo gives you a shocked look. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Nym, they&#039;re sick, or injured, not <em>dead</em>! You are a Necromancer, remember?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What did I just say about being stupid? I think I have a way to heal them- I&#039;ve never done it to anyone else, but I don&#039;t see why it wouldn&#039;t work. Now shut up and cast the bloody spell so we can get out of here!&quot;</span><br />Omo shrugs, then casts his spell. He grimaces at what he sees. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Nym, they&#039;re in pretty rough shape. Two vitality each. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s just the cold, or a prior injury, or something else, but they need help.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Will they make it to the village?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I think so. They should, anyway- I&#039;ll keep an eye on them, and let you know if they dip lower.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, let&#039;s not waste any more time then. You know the way out of the forest?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Do I know the- now who&#039;s being stupid? Follow me!&quot;</span><br /><br />Omo scoops up the boy, cradling him in one arm and holding the torch up with the other. You take the girl, holding her to your breast with both arms. Although you have lost your sense of direction after all the twists and turns beneath the trees with no stars or moon to guide you, Omo confidently sets off into the forest, quickly leading the way forward. He does not twist or turn to follow the trail that lead you here, instead making straight for the edge of the forest.<br /><br />At first, the quick pace is quite welcome, as you&#039;d like nothing better than to leave the oppressive forest behind you. Soon enough, however, your legs begin reminding you that you have been on your feet all day, a day of walking that caps off almost a week of nothing <em>but</em> walking- really, you haven&#039;t had a day of rest since the Caravan Fair, what seems so long ago. The small girl in your arms felt almost weightless when you picked her up, but ten minutes of walking later she feels like a heavy sack of potatoes. Your stomach chimes in to remind you that rather than eating dinner tonight, you elected to go wandering around scary forests instead. Taken together, the silent complaints of your body are almost enough to make you forget the unwelcoming atmosphere of your surroundings. Almost.<br /><br />Just when you think that you need to call for a brief rest even if you are still within the forest, Omo laughs in relief. Looking ahead, you can see the open plains of the countryside bathed in moonlight- it seems bright as day compared to the darkness beneath the trees. Another fifty feet, and you&#039;ll be in the clear.<br /><br />Suddenly, you whip your head around, searching behind you in the forest. Coming up behind you is a source of Necromantic Energy- three Vitality&#039;s worth, forty five feet away but moving fast, coming straight at you.<br /><br />Omo pauses, curiously looking back at you, wondering why you&#039;ve stopped. Should you run for the edge of the forest? The forest floor is treacherous with branches and rocks in the dark, and your load is heavy, but you&#039;re a surefooted pair of young elves, and you think you can outrace whatever it is behind you. Then again, it is definitely Necromantic, and you certainly handled those zombies readily enough- you&#039;ve been saving your Mana for just such an emergency. What should you do?<br /><br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 11/11<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 8/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 23/35<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">80 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Headband, Belt Knife, <abbr title="1d6 damage, Slashing">Hatchet</abbr>, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr>, <abbr title="See detailed workings of Necromancy">Improved Necromantic Sight(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr>, <abbr title="can swim in calm, peaceful waters">Dabbling Swimmer</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Holding a small girl<br /><strong>Twenty and a half</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - Detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - Causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - You can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><strong>Waterproof</strong>- 1MP/Hour duration - Makes an object non-absorbent.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />- Steal Vitality on self<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br />- Trying to develop a destroy vitality spell, using the same principles of the steal vitality, except without keeping it usable. It might be possible to do it for cheaper or causing more damage for the same mana.<br />- Trying to use the principles of the destroy vitality or the steal vitality spell for a disinfectant spell. It will require a lot of fine control, but it should theoretically be possible.<br />- We could also try to overbuff a zombie. Is there a max to the amount of vitality a zombie can have? And what happens if a zombie gets a lot of vitality?<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Northwest Thrimesdur<br /><a href="http://tnypic.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

Tell Omo to Run - keep it short and quick. And then MOVE. If it looks like it is going to catch up, steal vitality - we&#039;ll probably have to wait until it gets closer to succeed anyway. But be ready to do so. Although I honestly have my doubts as to whether or not that will work in this case - this forest obviously does strange things to necromantic energy. It&#039;s quite possible that there may be bad, bad results from using that sort of spell here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You start running toward the edge of the forest, shouting at Omo. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Move it! There&#039;s something behind us!&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Where? I don&#039;t see anything.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;<em>I</em> can see it, now RUN!&quot;</span><br /><br />Although clearly somewhat confused by what&#039;s happening, Omo wastes no time in running after you, quickly overtaking you with his long stride. As you duck between the trees and jump over shadowy roots, you glance over your shoulder, trying to get a better idea of what exactly you&#039;re fleeing from. Unlike the zombies, your pursuer sheds no light on its surroundings- you catch glimpses of purple only because of your Necromantic Sight. It doesn&#039;t seem to be very large, whatever it is- about as big as a dog, rumbling easily along the forest floor.<br /><br /><abbr title="Balance: Nym(7) Omo(12)">...</abbr> A long, rotted log suddenly looms in the darkness, but you easily climb over while Omo hurdles it without even breaking stride. As you rush through the trees, you see that your pursuer has a much more difficult time of it, taking the long way around the obstacle.<br /><br />A few strides later, you burst out into the open grass, putting a safe distance between yourselves and the forest. You anxiously eye the treeline, looking for sign of your pursuer- as before, however, your Necromantic sight does not seem to extend into the forest, and the darkness beneath the trees is too thick to see very far. Tensely, you and Omo watch the forest for several long moments, but nothing emerges into the moonlight. The only sound is the wind rustling the grass around you.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3877971#msg3877971">Quote from: LordBucket on Sun 16-12-2012, 03:31:23</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Carry the kids outside of this strange magic zone we&#039;re in.

Whatever stopped the zombies must have stopped whatever was chasing us, unless it&#039;s invisible. You did <em>see </em>it, right?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, only with my Necromantic Sight, but I don&#039;t see it now. How are the kids?&quot;</span><br />Omo carefully examines his charge, frowning. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;The boy is unchanged- I had really hoped that getting out of the forest would snap him out of his coma.&quot;</span> He groans softly when he leans over to check the girl in your arms. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;She&#039;s slipping, Nym- down to one Vitality. She might make it back to village, but...&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;But I&#039;ll feel better if she isn&#039;t on death&#039;s door the entire trip back. Let me try something.&quot;</span><br /><br />Crouching down, you lay the girl out on the ground, her eyes flashing in reflected moonlight. You quickly rule out stealing Vitality from a tree in the forest- quite apart from potential monsters lurking there, you aren&#039;t sure how far you can carry Vitality, or what effect the odd barrier around the forest might have on the spell. You briefly consider trying to harvest Vitality from the grass around you, but decide that there&#039;s one source of Vitality you should test first, a source that is always nearby, a source that hurts nobody else. Yourself, of course.<br /><br />Taking a quick breath, you cast the spell before you really think about how much this experiment will hurt. The good news is that the spell resolves, and you begin <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Stealing Vitality</span></strong></span></span> out of yourself- slowly, attempting to draw only what is needed. To your surprise, in the time it takes you to extract a little ball of One Vitality you find you&#039;ve only spent One Mana!<br /><br />The bad news is that it <em>does </em>hurt, about as much as your Undead Oak mishap. You shudder as you let out your breath. You feel like you did a bellyflop in the Great River back home, with the stinging spread all across your body. Tired muscles complain of new aches as a fresh layer of fatigue settles in. It&#039;s not the worst you&#039;ve ever been injured (that time you broke an arm falling out of a tree as a child comes to mind,) but it&#039;s certainly not a terribly pleasant experience.<br /><br />Taking another breath, you set aside your discomfort and focus on directing the floating glowing blob of Vitality. Carefully, you touch it to the girl, and it soaks into her body like water into a sponge. You glance up at Omo as he leans over the girl.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Two Vitality.&quot;</span> Omo nods, sighing. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Whatever you did worked, Nym.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Good. I gave her some of my own Vitality. It sucked, but if she makes it then it was worth it.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Huh.&quot;</span> Omo&#039;s mouth twists distastefully, then he shrugs. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, no point in waiting around here. Let&#039;s go back to the village.&quot;</span><br /><br />Omo leads the way back to the west, and soon you hit the road a little south of the farm. The walk back is long and tiring, but uneventful- if there are any zombies wandering in the night, you don&#039;t encounter them. Judging by the height of the moon, it&#039;s nearly midnight by the time the lights in the village of Bedscaled wink in the distance.<br /><br />Suddenly, a shadowy figure lurches out of the darkness. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>&quot;Oy! Who are you, coming from the East in the night!?!&quot;</strong></span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Do you think we&#039;re zombies, carrying torches around?&quot;</span> Omo scoffs at the pitchfork-wielding villager. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We found those kids who were missing. Rismal and Nelti. They aren&#039;t well- go get the priest!&quot;</span><br /><br />The villager starts, peering closer at your burden, then wordlessly turns around and runs to the village. He isn&#039;t wordless for long- as you trudge after him, you hear him calling out to other villagers. Soon, you are met by villagers armed with farming implements and old, rusty weapons, watchmen who had been guarding against another zombie attack. The clamor they raise is a peculiar blend of happiness to see the children alive, and worry over their catatonic state. The few houses with candles still lit disgorge sleepy men and women who had stayed up late to listen for news, or perhaps because they were unable to sleep in the first place. All in all, it&#039;s a small crowd that accompanies you to the Temple.<br /><br />As you approach the stairs to the Temple, the wooden double doors crash open, disgorging Eko Cleanvise. Moving surprisingly quickly for such a large man, the priest hurries over to you and Omo, examining the children tensely. He sighs, seeming to deflate as he takes in their appearance. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You found them in Aloclesno, didn&#039;t you?&quot;</span></span><br />You blink in surprise. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yes. It seems they fled there to escape the zombies. How did you know? Have you seen... this, before?&quot;</span> You say, indicating the sightless children.<br />Eko runs a hand through his thinning hair. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;No, nobody has been foolish enough to venture into the forest in years. In my lifetime, none who have have ever returned. The histories are clear about what happens to those who trespass there, though. Bring them inside, I will do what I can.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><strong>&quot;Will they be alright, Eko?&quot;</strong></span> A voice in the crowd calls out, followed by a worried murmur.<br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I said I&#039;d do what I can!&quot;</span></span> Eko says, raising his voice. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Go back to your homes! Go back to the watch- a fine thing if the zombies came while you were all gossiping on my steps!&quot;</span></span><br /><br />The crowd disperses quietly as you follow Eko inside the Temple. The Temple of Atal is not so large as the Temple in Larathor, nor is it decorated as lavishly, but it follows the same general format. The main doors lead to an atrium that resembles a broad hallway more than the open space you knew from Larathor, but it is similarly decorated with simple patterns and religious depictions. Eko leads the way into the inner chamber, a broad, perfectly square room filled with wooden benches surrounding an open square in the middle. The benches have been shoved aside to make room for a half dozen cots on the other side of the room- one of them is occupied by a snoring man whose body is obscured by the heavy blanket covering him. The opposite wall has another set of doors in it, identical to the ones you entered through.<br /><br />Omo follows Eko over to one of the empty cots, laying the small boy down. Relieved of his burden, Omo stretches and sighs, resting himself on another cot.<br /><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Thank you for rescuing the children, though I do not know if they will recover. I&#039;ll get you some food and blankets as soon as I see to the children- you&#039;re welcome to stay as long as you&#039;d like.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;That sounds good.&quot;</span> Omo says, knuckling his back. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I&#039;m starved, and I just might sleep until noon if I get the chance. I hope you&#039;re not planning to wake me up at the crack of dawn again, Nym.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br />- Trying to develop a destroy vitality spell, using the same principles of the steal vitality, except without keeping it usable. It might be possible to do it for cheaper or causing more damage for the same mana.<br />- Trying to use the principles of the destroy vitality or the steal vitality spell for a disinfectant spell. It will require a lot of fine control, but it should theoretically be possible.<br />- We could also try to overbuff a zombie. Is there a max to the amount of vitality a zombie can have? And what happens if a zombie gets a lot of vitality?<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Northwest Thrimesdur<br /><a href="http://tnypic.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

You keep your mind on the unexpected source of Necromantic Energy, but it does not seem to move at all, not even a little. You stand still for a moment, considering this information, before uncertainly lowering yourself onto the next cot over. It certainly feels good to be off your feet, and you stretch, trying to catch Omo&#039;s eye to signal that he should be alert- unfortunately, your friend is sprawled out on the cot on the far side of the children, kicking off his boots and making himself comfortable.<br /><br />Eko Cleanvise kneels in between the children, rummaging around his robes until he withdraws a short stick of white chalk. Carefully, he draws an inverted triangle on the girl&#039;s forehead, then a circle inscribed within it.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What are you doing?&quot;</span> You ask curiously.<br /><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;I&#039;m casting a spell to divine the nature of the child&#039;s... affliction.&quot;</span></span> Eko murmurs, concentrating on his task.<br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Oh. So what&#039;s the weird symbol for?&quot;</span> You ask curiously.<br />Eko blinks in surprise, then shrugs. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Well, technically, nothing. It is an aid to concentration, which will help me cast this spell in a reasonable time frame. Order magic requires your thoughts to be very clear and exact- orderly, I suppose you could say.&quot;</span></span> He chuckles. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Sorry, just a little Wizard humor.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Wizard? I thought you were a priest.&quot;</span> Omo says, rolling over to observe the spell.<br /><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;I am a Wizard by virtue of my inherent magical ability and training at the Wizard&#039;s College in Atkilpeme, and I am a Priest of Atal by virtue of my theological training and commitment to community service. Not all Wizards are priests, and not all priests are Wizards. Forgive me, but I must clear my mind of distractions to successfully cast this spell.&quot;</span></span><br /><br />So saying, Eko focuses his attention on the comatose girl, steepling his hands before him. At first, nothing seems to be happening, but then you notice a faint, nearly imperceptible white light enveloping the child. Slowly, the light intensifies into a bright, even glow surrounding the girl from head to toe, almost seeming to radiate from her. Suddenly the light flashes, causing you to blink from the brightness. It flashes again, then again, then four times in quick succession. A few moments after the final flash, the glow fades away and Eko sighs heavily.<br /><br /><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Well. It is as I feared- there is no physical cause for their stupor. She hasn&#039;t eaten or drank for almost two days now, and she&#039;s borderline hypothermic, but that&#039;s nothing a few days of bed rest won&#039;t cure. I&#039;ll confirm that Rismal is in the same state as Nelti, but I&#039;ll have to wait until tomorrow morning to be absolutely sure- that spell is a bit involved, and I do not have the Mana to cast it tonight.&quot;</span></span> Eko shakes his head sadly, producing a small brass flask from beneath his robes and taking a quick drink.<br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You said you thought you knew what was wrong. That this is what happens to the people who enter the forest.&quot;</span> You prompt the priest.<br />Eko nods, wiping his mouth. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Yes. Aloclesno is a cursed place, cursed by Balkoth the Necromancer more than a thousand years ago.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Balkoth?&quot;</span> You say, surprised.<br /><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;It happened in the final years of the Golgothan War... well, just a moment.&quot;</span></span> Eko says, standing. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;The story is a long one, and the children need food. And you as well, unless I miss my guess.&quot;</span></span> He says wryly as Omo perks up. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Give me a few minutes to warm up some soup, and I&#039;ll tell you all about it.&quot;</span></span><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3891549#msg3891549">Quote from: LordBucket on Fri 21-12-2012, 06:15:06</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Agreed.

Sitting up quickly, he puts a hand on the quarterstaff he had set on the floor. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Something... you&#039;re familiar with, right? One of those?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Right.&quot;</span> You nod. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I don&#039;t know what, exactly.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Can&#039;t you tell?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well...&quot;</span> You chew your lip thoughtfully. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It could be our friend from the forest. It could be something that&#039;s been there for years, and they just don&#039;t know about it. It could be an artifact. It could be something else entirely. If it&#039;s undead, I could try to Command it, but that&#039;s hard to do when you don&#039;t know what exactly you&#039;re commanding. You need a certain amount of empathy for that. I could guess randomly, it might work, I suppose. I could even make a little spy for us, but I don&#039;t know if any of that would give us away. I don&#039;t know enough about his wards, and if it&#039;s something unexpected down there, well...&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So what do we do, then?&quot;</span> Omo hisses.<br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It hasn&#039;t moved an inch since we got here, so I don&#039;t think it&#039;s an immediate threat. Just, keep your eyes open. We don&#039;t know what it is, and we don&#039;t know if our host knows about it.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You think the priest might be...?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I don&#039;t know, okay? Just play it by ear.&quot;</span><br /><br />You return to your cot as Omo lowers himself back onto his, grumbling under his breath. You lie down- the cot is surprisingly comfortable, and you <em>are </em>quite tired. Before long, Eko returns with a steaming pot in his hands, his head nearly obscured by the blankets he has draped over himself. After setting the pot down, he gives you and Omo each a large, thick blanket and a wooden bowl. You identify some kind of crusty bread at the bottom of the bowl before Eko ladles hot broth over it with a long wooden spoon, as well as some bits of meat and vegetables he scoops off the bottom of the pot.<br /><br />You eat in silence while he serves Omo- the soup is quite good, if plain. You suspect the chicken that provided the meat was a bit past its prime, but after a long day of nothing but trail rations the hot soup is quite welcome. You finish the bowl while Eko repeats his earlier spell, this time checking the boy. He shakes his head upon completing the spell, then ladles a small spoonful of broth out of the pot. After carefully blowing on it, Eko gently feeds the boy, rubbing his throat to make him swallow.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Thank you for the meal.&quot;</span> You say, breaking the silence. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Do you cook for yourself a lot?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;For the most part, yes. Usually I&#039;m the only one here- sometimes a goodwife will bring me some dinner if they&#039;re feeling charitable, but normally I fend for myself with the stipend the Empire gives me. This particular meal, however, comes to us courtesy of Ado Drunkenstumbles&#039; wife.&quot;</span></span> Eko nods at the sleeping man at the other end of the room. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;I always eat better when I&#039;m tending to the sick, and for a while after, too- while their gratitude lasts, anyway.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Mmm. So is that what you do here, then?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Tend the sick, teach the children, officiate ceremonies, the usual, yes. That, and maintain the wards.&quot;</span></span> Eko replies, feeding the boy another spoonful.<br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I heard you mention the wards earlier. What exactly do they do?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;They keep the undead at bay. It&#039;s an important duty, especially with Aloclesno so close.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yes, but how do they work, exactly? I heard they didn&#039;t work for some reason, on the farms last night.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;They worked, as far as I can tell.&quot;</span></span> Eko scowls. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;They&#039;re still up, still working. It should have been impossible for the zombies to get past- the wards block their sight, and create something like an aversion. They should have avoided the place, and certainly not seen anything within the wards to attack. I need to find out how they bypassed those wards- until I do, the whole village is at risk.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;All they do is block sight? What if the zombies just blundered in?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;It&#039;s possible, technically, but unlikely. Certainly not for three separate attacks. From what I understand, the undead aren&#039;t very bright and they simply do not have curiosity- those farmhouses should have been no more interesting than a roadside boulder, something to walk around, not through.&quot;</span></span> Eko finishes feeding the boy, and moves on to the girl.<br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;And these wards are around the forest, too? Aloclesno?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Yes. Aloclesno... well, I&#039;ll start at the beginning, back during the Golgothan War. When Balkoth invaded Thrimesdur, his forces were divided in two- an army of mostly undead led by Balkoth sweeping up to threaten Atkilpeme from the south, and a larger force made up of the Golgothans and Balkoth&#039;s lieutenants who fought their way from the East. The bulk of the Imperial forces were tied up on the Eastern front engaging the much larger army there. Balkoth smashed the first army sent against his force, and drove the remnants back into Aloclesno.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;They retreated back into the forest? Just like these children did.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Indeed, but at that time Aloclesno was just another forest, a fine source of lumber for the surrounding villages, nothing more. The leader of that army was one of the Emperor&#039;s sons, and he was known as Girus the Fox for his cunning in battle. Although he could not defeat Balkoth in the open field, he knew he couldn&#039;t allow Balkoth to march to Atkilpeme uncontested. Girus rallied surrounding villages to make up for his lost numbers and began waging a guerrilla campaign, slashing at Balkoth&#039;s flanks, disrupting his supply lines, and using the farmers&#039; knowledge of the surroundings to strike hard at zombies away from the main army before falling back to Aloclesno.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Supply lines? How many supplies does an army of undead need?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;There were enough Golgothans with his force that the disruption was quite costly, and even the undead couldn&#039;t loot all the equipment they needed to fight effectively against the seasoned veterans awaiting them in Atkilpeme. In any event, the threat from his rear was enough to stop Balkoth&#039;s advance. He was unwilling to spend the time and resources it would take to root out Girus and his army from their position in the forest, where the defenders would have a decided advantage, and he was also unwilling to leave such a large, competent force at his back while he marched on the capital. So instead, he took a third option. Balkoth released a monster in the forest.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;A monster? What do you mean?&quot;</span><br />Eko shrugs. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Nobody knows. Nobody saw it. Nobody is even sure that it <em>was </em>a monster- it could have been some kind of Necromancy never before seen, never used since, though anecdotal evidence suggests that it was a creature of some kind. All we know is that soldiers living in the forest started to... well, they didn&#039;t die, is the worst part. They were as the children are now- unresponsive, seemingly lifeless but still breathing, still alive. The Living Dead, some scholars call it. It spread like a plague- first a handful of soldiers, then another dozen, then a company. Every morning, men would rise to find more of their comrades already awake, but unaware.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;But, what was wrong with them?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;They didn&#039;t know at first- cripplingly, their Wizards had died in the initial confrontation with Balkoth, and by the time they knew what was going on it was too late. After a few days, desertion was rampant, and Girus was forced to withdraw from the forest with a fraction of his army. Hounded by zombies, he withdrew to the West, hoping to raise another army before Balkoth could sack Atkilpeme. They managed to bring some of the afflicted to the cities on the Great River, and the Wizards there were able to identify the problem- the soldiers had had their souls removed.&quot;</span></span> Somberly, Eko raises his flask to his lips.<br />You are silent for a long moment. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Uh... what&#039;s a soul?&quot;</span> Omo asks, scratching his head.<br />Eko coughs, spluttering on his drink. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;What&#039;s a.. <em>what&#039;s a soul</em>? Did you pay <em>no </em>attention to your priest, boy?&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We&#039;re, ah, from far away.&quot;</span> You say carefully. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Maybe we call it something else.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Far away...&quot;</span></span> He gives you a considering look, then stabs a finger at you. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;You, my dear, are an elf.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I- well, yes. We don&#039;t advertise the fact- we prefer to keep a low profile.&quot;</span><br />Eko shakes his head. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;I should have figured it out before now- your clothes and appearance are enough, if I hadn&#039;t been distracted by the children. I&#039;m sure you have a story to tell, but you&#039;re my guests, and I won&#039;t make you tell it if you don&#039;t want to. Well. The soul is... it&#039;s the animating spirit, I suppose you could say. Everything living has one- humans, elves, animals, bugs... well maybe not bugs, I&#039;ve never asked. Think of a zombie- they walk around, their bodies move, but they aren&#039;t really <em>alive</em>. They don&#039;t think, they have no ambition, no personality- they&#039;re just empty shells. Your body is just a sack of meat that carries you around, and the part of you that is uniquely <em>you </em>is the soul.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Oh. And those soldiers, these kids... they lost that?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></span> Eko says heavily. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;In some way, these children are already dead. With daily care their bodies could go on for years, but there&#039;s nothing really there, inside.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;But they&#039;re otherwise fine, right? If they got their soul back, they&#039;d be good as new?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Well, I suppose, but somehow I doubt there is still a soul to return, even if there was some way to do it.&quot;</span></span> Eko says, taking another draw from his flask.<br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So the wards around the forest are there to keep the monster in?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Yes, and also no. It wasn&#039;t clear that the forest was still dangerous until after the Golgothan War, when some of the farmers and lumberjacks who entered never came back. They were found in the same state as the soldiers had been, and the forest was quickly declared off-limits. Nobody has ever been attacked outside the forest, but just for safety the forest is ringed with wards maintained by local Wizards, and many of the nearby farms and settlements have an additional ward as well. Every now and then somebody will go into the forest for some fool reason or other, but the result is always the same- they never return, and those that aren&#039;t given up for dead are found like this.&quot;</span></span><br /><br />The priest sadly watches the children for a long moment, then visibly collects himself. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Well! I&#039;ve rambled enough with my old stories- I&#039;m sure you would like to get some sleep tonight. I&#039;ll be just through the next door here if you need anything. Sleep well.&quot;</span></span> Moving around the room, Eko dims the lanterns in the corners, leaving only one burning low before retiring deeper into the Temple.<br /><br />Yawning, you burrow into your blankets, the priest&#039;s story churning through your mind. It doesn&#039;t seem right that the children will die anyway, after all you did to bring them out of the forest. You ponder the nature of Balkoth&#039;s spell- if it was Necromancy, then it could be something you can replicate, if you can piece together how. The Necromantic presence beneath you still hasn&#039;t moved- another mystery. With another yawn, you drift off to sleep, already thinking about what you will do tomorrow.<br /><br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 9/11<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 7/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 24/35<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">80 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Headband, Belt Knife, <abbr title="1d6 damage, Slashing">Hatchet</abbr>, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr>, <abbr title="See detailed workings of Necromancy">Improved Necromantic Sight(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr>, <abbr title="can swim in calm, peaceful waters">Dabbling Swimmer</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Holding a small girl<br /><strong>Twenty and a half</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - Detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - Causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - You can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><strong>Waterproof</strong>- 1MP/Hour duration - Makes an object non-absorbent.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br />- Trying to develop a destroy vitality spell, using the same principles of the steal vitality, except without keeping it usable. It might be possible to do it for cheaper or causing more damage for the same mana.<br />- Trying to use the principles of the destroy vitality or the steal vitality spell for a disinfectant spell. It will require a lot of fine control, but it should theoretically be possible.<br />- We could also try to overbuff a zombie. Is there a max to the amount of vitality a zombie can have? And what happens if a zombie gets a lot of vitality?<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Northwest Thrimesdur<br /><a href="http://tnypic.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

You groan softly when you realize the hour, but although you give some serious thought to going back to bed you regretfully conclude that you are now awake, and you won&#039;t fall asleep again easily. You sit up and rub the sleep from your eyes. Seeing you stir, Eko smiles and beckons you to follow him further into the Temple, away from the other sleepers.<br /><br />Stifling a yawn, you stretch as you stand up. The Necromantic Energy below you is in the exact same place it was when you went to bed. You pause for a moment- the children are also exactly as you last saw them, eyes open, staring at the ceiling. Omo has tangled his blankets rather thoroughly, and a snore intermittently escapes from the tangled sheets. You think of the ways your sight has changed, and how you can see things differently now. You try to detect a difference between the soulless children and the slumbering elf, but no matter how you squint you see nothing. If Necromancers can see souls, it must not be an ability you possess yet, unless there&#039;s some other trick you don&#039;t know yet...<br /><br />You push it from your mind and follow Eko. The next room turns out to be a combination kitchen and living room. It is almost uncomfortably warm due to the large fireplace that no doubt heats most of the Temple, an iron pot bubbling over the flames. The wall to the left is lined with cupboards and cabinets, every surface covered with dirty dishes, loose papers, an old hammer, and other detritus of daily life. A small table with two chairs takes up the space to the right, along with a comfy-looking armchair positioned near the fire.<br /><br />You regard the door to the left with some small interest, as the symbol Eko wears around his neck is engraved into it, but the priest shows you to the door on the right wall. It opens into a narrow, dark hallway. Although you can see another door further down, Eko directs your attention to the nearest door- a washroom complete with a large, steaming bowl of water. Thanking the priest profusely, you pause only to fetch a change of clothes from your pack before satisfying some basic needs.<br /><br />When you emerge some minutes later, clean and refreshed, you find Eko spooning a porridge of oats and beans into a bowl for you. You eye the mixture somewhat doubtfully, especially when Eko pours a cup of milk into the bowl along with a couple slices of dried apple. Despite your trepidation, however, it turns out to be... entirely palatable. It certainly lacks in flavor and texture, but it isn&#039;t <em>repulsive </em>and it is quite filling.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So... this porridge is good.&quot;</span> You say, breaking the silence.<br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You are kind to say so.&quot;</span></span> Eko replies, grinning slightly. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It is easy to swallow and easy to digest, ideal for sick patients.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Ah. For the children, then. What are you going to do for them?&quot;</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, I confirmed their condition while you were still asleep- peace and quiet really does help the spellcasting process, you know.&quot;</span></span> Eko&#039;s grin fades, and he sighs. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;There isn&#039;t much I can do for them at this point. I will feed them, give them water, keep their bodies alive, and if their condition does not improve in a month&#039;s time... well, I will allow nature to take its course.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You&#039;ll let the children die?&quot;</span> You say incredulously.<br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What else can I do? My magics have failed me again. The records say that in the past we&#039;ve called on healers from all faiths, even the Elves, but the Mages could do nothing for us. These bodies could easily persist into old age if we cared for them, but for what purpose? They are already dead, and the living still need my care.&quot;</span></span><br /><br />An awkward silence descends on the room. Eko stares moodily into the crackling flames, absently patting at his robes. You cough discreetly into one hand, casting about for a change of subject.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Um... your wards only block sight, right?&quot;</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;That&#039;s right.&quot;</span></span> Eko nods.<br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Can they do anything else? Can they actually block the zombies, or raise an alarm?&quot;</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Sufficiently powerful wards could, yes. The strongest wards I can cast would not do much other than slow down the undead for a time, and would take me some time to cast in the first place. The only reason I haven&#039;t cast more powerful wards is because they are quite mana-intensive; before the zombies there was no need for stronger wards, and now I must reserve a portion of my mana in case it is needed to repel an attack.&quot;</span></span><br />You blink in surprise. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Your magic can repel zombies?&quot;</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;If it comes to that. I specialize in defensive wards, but no Wizard situated near the haunted forest can serve without knowing some specialty spells. Undead are an aberration from the natural order- it stand to reason a Wizard can restore it.&quot;</span></span> Eko shrugs. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I don&#039;t know how effective I can be- more likely I will need the mana for healing spells. Either way, I cannot overexert myself in good conscience.&quot;</span></span><br />You blink in surprise. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Oh. Well, your wards- can they repel loose souls?&quot;</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Your concern for the children is touching, but no, their souls are not trapped in the forest by my wards, if that&#039;s what you are getting at. I do know wards for protection against spirits and ghosts, but none of those are in place around the forest. And remember, there were many victims before it was thought needful to ward the forest- they lay comatose for years, but never recovered.&quot;</span></span><br /><br />You are about to ask another question, but at that moment Omo enters the room, drawn by the smell of breakfast. You make small talk while Eko goes to feed the children and his other patient. Afterward, he disappears through the door to the right, reemerging a few moments later with a walking stick. He slips his flask into his robes and tightens the laces on his boots.<br /><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I&#039;m afraid I must leave for a time- I need to check the wards on the outlying farms, and I plan to set some new wards to give the village warning of another attack. The Temple is open to you- what food isn&#039;t in here is in the storeroom down the hall, and I have some books in my room if you wish to read, though you may find the subject matter dry. I should only be gone a few hours.&quot;</span></span> <br /><br />You make your farewells, trying in vain to come up with a way to casually mention the basement. Eko Cleanvise steps onto the road East, purposefully making his way out of town and ignoring one villager&#039;s hail. You return to the kitchen, where Omo is finishing up his breakfast.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I hope they don&#039;t all eat like this in Thrimesdur. So, are we moving on today?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I don&#039;t want to go yet, maybe not for a while. At the least, I&#039;d like to find out what&#039;s going on in the basement. Maybe if I experiment enough, I can find a way to help the children.&quot;</span><br />Omo scrapes the last soggy bean out of his bowl before pushing it away. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, what should we do first?&quot;</span><br /><br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 10/11<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 12/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 24/35<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">80 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Headband, Belt Knife, <abbr title="1d6 damage, Slashing">Hatchet</abbr>, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr>, <abbr title="See detailed workings of Necromancy">Improved Necromantic Sight(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr>, <abbr title="can swim in calm, peaceful waters">Dabbling Swimmer</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Sitting in the Temple<br /><strong>Twenty one</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - Detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - Causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - You can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><strong>Waterproof</strong>- 1MP/Hour duration - Makes an object non-absorbent.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br />- Trying to develop a destroy vitality spell, using the same principles of the steal vitality, except without keeping it usable. It might be possible to do it for cheaper or causing more damage for the same mana.<br />- Trying to use the principles of the destroy vitality or the steal vitality spell for a disinfectant spell. It will require a lot of fine control, but it should theoretically be possible.<br />- We could also try to overbuff a zombie. Is there a max to the amount of vitality a zombie can have? And what happens if a zombie gets a lot of vitality?<br />&nbsp;* Remove someone&#039;s soul. Try to store it for a time in a living thing like a tree, or confine it in a mana crystal, then put it back later. See if they&#039;re functional.<br />&nbsp;* Attempt to swap souls between two different bodies.<br />&nbsp;* Carefully attempt to displace our own soul from our own body. See if we can move around apart from our bodies, like astral projection. See if we can cast while in this state, enter other occupied bodies like a possession, then return to our body later.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Northwest Thrimesdur<br /><a href="http://tnypic.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Author&#039;s Note</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3936701#msg3936701">Quote from: Corruptor on Tue 08-01-2013, 22:08:01</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3936288#msg3936288">Quote from: GlyphGryph on Tue 08-01-2013, 17:31:33</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Mooooonk?<br /><br />Are you still aliiiiive?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Or failing that, undead?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg3936724#msg3936724">Quote from: Angle on Tue 08-01-2013, 22:22:46</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Cast <strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Raise Thread</span></strong>.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This year for Christmas I got the Indiana Jones Trilogy on DVD, Adventure Time Season 1, and a super annoying cold.

The children are as you left them, but the man in the far cot is awake and sitting up, leaning back on his pillows. You cast about for a name- Ado Drunkenstumbles, a survivor of the zombie attack. Seeing him out from under his blankets, you realize that he is hurt quite badly- his left side is swathed in bandages, and his face and arms are heavily bruised.&nbsp; He directs a sour look at you as you enter- you nearly turn around and leave, but decide to press on. You&#039;re sharing sleeping quarters, after all, and it seems as though his dour mood has more to do with his own bedridden state rather than anything you&#039;ve done.<br /><br />Standing by the children, you decide to start with your <strong>Detect Magic</strong> spell, as you&#039;ll want that active during your explorations anyway. Unfortunately, as far as you can tell they are completely free of magical energy. However, you quickly notice that the same cannot be said for Ado Drunkenstumbles- he seems to be wearing a layer of magic like a second skin. It&#039;s no magic you are familiar with, but it seems likely to be some form of healing, given the circumstances.<br /><br />You realize you&#039;ve been staring when Ado fixes you with a glare of his own, and you hastily return your attention to the children. You discreetly cast <strong>Sense Vitality</strong>, and frown at what you feel- two Vitality each. That&#039;s what they had when you brought them back last night, and although it wasn&#039;t all that long ago you would still have expected them to recover <em>some </em>Vitality. Maybe it&#039;s just shock from their rough treatment, or maybe it&#039;s an effect of their soullessness. You wonder why Eko didn&#039;t cast any healing spells for them the way it seems he did for Ado.<br /><br />Uncomfortably aware of Ado&#039;s continued observation, you decide to check one last thing. Quickly, you stride to the outer doors, where you had first noticed the Necromantic presence in the basement. Sure enough, you find a faint line of magical energy, seeming to disappear into the walls. Again, you don&#039;t recognize what sort of magic it is (though it seems distantly related to the spell on Ado- perhaps because they are both Order spells?) but you would bet anything that this is a ward similar to what encircles the forest. Experimentally, you step outside for a moment- sure enough, your awareness of the Necromantic Energy vanishes.<br /><br />You glance up the road in the direction Eko left- of course, you see nothing but a few villagers going about their business. You go back inside, quickly walking through the main room and into the kitchen where Omo is waiting.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well?&quot;</span> Omo raises an inquiring eyebrow.<br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;They&#039;re unchanged.&quot;</span> You sigh. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Completely unchanged- they don&#039;t seem to be healing at all.&quot;</span><br />Omo grunts. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, I didn&#039;t really expect anything different.&quot;</span> Omo points at the door marked with Eko&#039;s symbol. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I stuck my head in there, and it looks like an office to me, and where he keeps his ceremonial things. Eko&#039;s bedroom is at the end of the hall- not much in there except a shelf full of books I don&#039;t understand. But that storeroom he mentioned had a trapdoor in the corner.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;The basement, then. Let&#039;s go.&quot;</span><br /><br />Omo leads you to the storeroom, a small space crammed with cupboards and shelves. The shelves themselves are rather sparce- a few sacks of grain, a keg of ale, a bowl of dried fruit, and another big pot of that soup from last night. Omo moves straight to the far corner, pulling up on an iron ring set in the floor. The trapdoor swings up, resting on the wall and revealing a steep staircase descending into darkness.<br /><br />You light an oil lamp sitting on a nearby shelf and cautiously walk down the stairs. The air smells musty down here, with that peculiar damp earthy scent familiar from the wine cellars back in Yicelafo. You are also surprised to smell a spicy odor that must have been pungent when it was fresh- you find a shallow bowl with scented candles resting on a barrel at the base of the stairs. The basement is full of junk of all kinds. A bucket of nails rests on a short stack of wooden planks next to a char with a splintered and broken back. One wall is lined with barrels, some full of food, some filled with tools, most covered with a rough tarp. Thick coils of rope hang from hooks on another wall, along with rusty, broken lanterns, a short ladder, and a tasseled spear. What appears to be a narrow window high on the wall has been boarded up.<br /><br />Omo peers about the cluttered room uneasily, but you pay little attention to the dancing shadows. You walk across the basement to a cleared section of wall. Along the wall here there are obvious holes in the rough stone floor, covered with thick wooden hatches. You don&#039;t know what might be stored in such places, nor do you investigate- one hatch is covered with a tarp and a barrel. You might not have realized that the hatches extended that far if it were not clearly the source of the Necromantic energy.<br /><br />You check the area. You detect no wards, nor any magic of any kind. Signalling to Omo, you wrestle the barrel away, then pull the tarp clear. The hatch beneath is shut securely. The Necromantic energy hasn&#039;t moved at all, not since the moment you first stepped into the temple. Omo shoots you a questioning look, and at your nod he grabs the handle, pulling the hatch open.<br /><br />The zombie below lurches against its restraints, silently struggling to attack you.<br /><br />You step back, suppressing a retch. The zombie is quite thoroughly decayed, and the stench of rotting flesh is overpowering. Omo curses, coughing as he jumps back. You put a hand to your nose and lean back over, examining the zombie. The bloated and rotten corpse is wearing the dirty, tattered remnants of a soldier&#039;s uniform over a stained suit of leather armor. It is missing one leg. The creature is held in place by lengths of thick rope, binding it to a pair of wooden boards wedged between the walls of its prison, holding it immobile. Some of the rope is loose where it has sawed into rotten flesh. You grimace- upon closer inspection, the zombie&#039;s arms are nailed to the wood. Its glowing purple eyes remain fixed on you as it strains to break free.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Blood and ashes!&quot;</span> Omo scowls in disgust. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What <em>is</em> this?&quot;</span><br /><br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 10/11<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 10/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 24/35<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">80 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Headband, Belt Knife, <abbr title="1d6 damage, Slashing">Hatchet</abbr>, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr>, <abbr title="See detailed workings of Necromancy">Improved Necromantic Sight(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr>, <abbr title="can swim in calm, peaceful waters">Dabbling Swimmer</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Super grossed out<br /><strong>Twenty one</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - Detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - Causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - You can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><strong>Waterproof</strong>- 1MP/Hour duration - Makes an object non-absorbent.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br />- Trying to develop a destroy vitality spell, using the same principles of the steal vitality, except without keeping it usable. It might be possible to do it for cheaper or causing more damage for the same mana.<br />- Trying to use the principles of the destroy vitality or the steal vitality spell for a disinfectant spell. It will require a lot of fine control, but it should theoretically be possible.<br />- We could also try to overbuff a zombie. Is there a max to the amount of vitality a zombie can have? And what happens if a zombie gets a lot of vitality?<br />&nbsp;* Remove someone&#039;s soul. Try to store it for a time in a living thing like a tree, or confine it in a mana crystal, then put it back later. See if they&#039;re functional.<br />&nbsp;* Attempt to swap souls between two different bodies.<br />&nbsp;* Carefully attempt to displace our own soul from our own body. See if we can move around apart from our bodies, like astral projection. See if we can cast while in this state, enter other occupied bodies like a possession, then return to our body later.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Northwest Thrimesdur<br /><a href="http://tnypic.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

If I found a body that looked like this, I would say it died a few weeks ago, a month at the outside. I don&#039;t know if being reanimated as a zombie preserves it at all- I certainly don&#039;t see any maggots or beetles or the like. It&#039;s about as decayed as the zombies we fought outside Aloclesno, though. The uniform is the same.&quot;</span><br />Omo spits off to one side, ignoring your disapproving look. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So what, somebody put it down here recently? Do we still suspect Eko of Necromancy?&quot;</span><br />You shake your head. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;No. Not really. Eko has cast several Order spells, and if he were a Necromancer he wouldn&#039;t have to restrain the zombie, he could just order it to be still.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Then why the secrecy? Why lock it in the basement where nobody can find it, under a pile of junk? How did he even get it <em>down</em> here? If he can&#039;t control it then it must have been trying to claw his face off the whole time.&quot;</span><br /><br />You look around, troubled. You see no signs of a struggle, no stains of blood on the ground, nothing unusually smashed or disorderly in the general clutter. Eko might simply be very good at cleaning up after himself- indeed, there is very little dust or dirt down here- but it would still be very difficult for one man to wrestle a zombie by himself, even with its missing leg.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I think he was experimenting on it.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Experimenting?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yeah. That would explain why he wouldn&#039;t just destroy it right away, and it&#039;s probably not something that would sit well with the villagers. Let&#039;s see if we can find any notes, something to explain what exactly he was doing.&quot;</span><br /><br />Omo gives you a doubtful look, but gathers up the tarp. You briefly consider using Command Undead to calm the zombie, allowing you to search the body in detail or perhaps check if it has memories that could yield a clue, but ultimately you decide not to tamper in any way that might be detected Eko or anyone else. Shutting the hatch, you replace the tarp and barrel and begin searching the basement.<br /><br />The other hatches along the wall are all empty, their purpose as mysterious as ever. Methodically, you and Omo work through the piles of junk and old furniture, searching for anything out of the ordinary. Just when you begin to consider going back upstairs to check out Eko&#039;s office, Omo waves from across the room, pulling a folded piece of paper out from within a shuttered lantern. You walk over to where he is smoothing it out on the top of a barrel, reading over his shoulder.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<del><em>minor ward</em></del><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<del><em>minor ward no restraint</em></del><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<del><em>stone</em></del><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<del><em>spear</em></del><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<del><em>detect undead</em></del><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<del><em>detect thoughts</em></del><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<del><em>detect magic</em></del><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<del><em>probe thoughts</em></del><br /><br />You frown. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;A spell list?&quot;</span><br />Omo snorts. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;They aren&#039;t all spells, unless you think he cast &quot;spear&quot; on that zombie.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Some of those must be spells, though. I know a ward is what Eko calls his defenses against the undead, and even I know how to cast Detect Magic.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Do you think they&#039;re all general spells? Maybe he&#039;s a Necromancer after all.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I don&#039;t know. It doesn&#039;t feel right- the spells I felt upstairs didn&#039;t feel like general magic to me.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, what do we do now?&quot;</span><br /><br />What indeed- you can&#039;t have been down here for more than an hour, meaning you still have some hours before Eko returns. You&#039;ve searched the basement rather thoroughly- it might not hurt to search other rooms in more depth, or perform some experiments of your own. You do not know why- or how- Eko would perform these experiments, and precious little information to extrapolate from.<br /><br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 10/11<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 10/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 24/35<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">80 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Headband, Belt Knife, <abbr title="1d6 damage, Slashing">Hatchet</abbr>, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr>, <abbr title="See detailed workings of Necromancy">Improved Necromantic Sight(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr>, <abbr title="can swim in calm, peaceful waters">Dabbling Swimmer</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Super grossed out<br /><strong>Twenty one</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - Detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - Causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - You can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><strong>Waterproof</strong>- 1MP/Hour duration - Makes an object non-absorbent.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br />- Trying to develop a destroy vitality spell, using the same principles of the steal vitality, except without keeping it usable. It might be possible to do it for cheaper or causing more damage for the same mana.<br />- Trying to use the principles of the destroy vitality or the steal vitality spell for a disinfectant spell. It will require a lot of fine control, but it should theoretically be possible.<br />- We could also try to overbuff a zombie. Is there a max to the amount of vitality a zombie can have? And what happens if a zombie gets a lot of vitality?<br />&nbsp;* Remove someone&#039;s soul. Try to store it for a time in a living thing like a tree, or confine it in a mana crystal, then put it back later. See if they&#039;re functional.<br />&nbsp;* Attempt to swap souls between two different bodies.<br />&nbsp;* Carefully attempt to displace our own soul from our own body. See if we can move around apart from our bodies, like astral projection. See if we can cast while in this state, enter other occupied bodies like a possession, then return to our body later.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Northwest Thrimesdur<br /><a href="http://tnypic.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Author&#039;s Note</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg4071920#msg4071920">Quote from: RAM on Sat 02-03-2013, 20:23:52</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It is unlikely to be christian iconography, given that life and order nations don&#039;t seem to be that way inclined, although I suppose water is always a possibility(I seem to think that water has proper knights for some reason, which would be silly, because knights traditionally dislike floating...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s not that knights dislike floating, it&#039;s that they dislike <em>sinking</em> <img src="./Necromancer/7.gif" alt="&#58;P" title="Tongue" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Though I will confirm yes, no intentional IRL religious symbolism here.<br /></div></div></div>

He steps back in distaste as you fold back the tarp and open the trapdoor, pinching your nose against the stench. A cursory glance shows no difference between the Necromantic Energy forming this zombie and the zombies you encountered outside the forest of Aloclesno. You still don&#039;t know whether you can distinguish the creator of individual zombies by sight, but considering the soldier&#039;s uniform and the similar stages of decay it seems quite likely that this zombie is of a kind with the others.<br /><br />Taking a deep breath, you <abbr title="2 Mana"><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">Command Undead</span></strong></span></span></abbr>, merging your consciousness with the restrained undead soldier. You gain intimate knowledge of the zombie&#039;s physical state, but it&#039;s nothing you were unaware of just from looking at it. The zombie&#039;s last (indeed, current) orders are an imperative along the lines of &quot;Move toward this star, kill the living, return with the corpses.&quot; It&#039;s certainly a more complex order than you&#039;ve attempted to give before, and is in fact more complex than the orders you found in the mind of the zombie outside Aloclesno- that zombie only had an order to kill, not to move or gather bodies afterward. In particular, the movement order is fairly intricate- instead of a series of directions on how to find the target star, you find a mental picture.<br /><br />To the right, empty plains seem to glow beneath a bright moon high in the sky, running up to a dark, shadowed forest on the left, one bright star low on the distant horizon clearly associated with the order to walk. Two more zombies can be seen standing to the right of your field of view, though in truth the edges of the image are fuzzy and indistinct- only the area around the star is truly focused and clear. One of the other zombies you can see wields a long spear, and from the corner of your eye you can see a spear that must be held by the viewer himself- or rather, itself, as you get the distinct impression that the picture is something seen by the zombie in the past.<br /><br />You frown pensively. You can&#039;t tell when exactly this order was given, but you can make a guess based on the mental image held by the zombie. Based on maps you&#039;ve seen, the only forest for miles around is Aloclesno, unless this zombie has been walking west for a great deal longer than you think it has. That possibility is exceptionally unlikely, considering the moon the zombie remembers is not quite full- the moon was last night was close enough to full as to make no difference. Living beneath the branches of Yicelafo your entire life has kept you from being intimate with the phases of the moon, but you more than suspect this zombie was given its orders <em>before</em> the most recent attack- perhaps a few days before.<br /><br />You keep digging- the ability to remember an image of such detail certainly suggests that the undead are capable of some degree of memory, more than you had expected. Unfortunately, no matter how you fumble around in the zombie&#039;s mind, you cannot seem to find anything else. No thoughts other than its last order, no memories of anything since that order, or any memories of life before zombification. You briefly entertain the idea of Commanding the zombie to remember, or just clearing it&#039;s memory to see if anything else turns up, but decide against it. It doesn&#039;t seem likely to work, and it may betray your meddling.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What are you doing, anyway?&quot;</span> Omo asks, not quite looking at the zombie.<br />You sigh, closing the trapdoor. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I was trying to search its thoughts.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Zombies have thoughts?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Not really, no. However, it seems they do remember orders. This one remembers more detail than I thought any zombie could. Omo, I&#039;m pretty sure this zombie was sent this way before the last attack. That&#039;s when it got its last orders, anyway.&quot;</span><br />Omo scowls, pacing back and forth in the narrow confines of the basement. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Blood and... that would mean Eko knew the zombies were coming before the attack, wouldn&#039;t it?&quot;</span><br />You run a hand through your hair thoughtfully. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I suppose so. Something doesn&#039;t add up, though. It&#039;s not like the villagers don&#039;t know about Curo Nightroar- his army has already depopulated most of the villages north of here. He must have had some reason to keep a captive zombie secret.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It had better be a good reason- if the villagers had known that zombies were nearby, they might have fared better in the attack. The soldiers we spoke to didn&#039;t seem to think there were many undead this far south of the highway.&quot;</span><br />You shrug. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I think we&#039;ve explored everything we can down here. Let&#039;s head upstairs.&quot;</span><br /><br />Once more straightening out the basement, you return to the main floor of the temple. You&#039;ve already seen what there is to see in the washroom and kitchen, so you decide to check out Eko&#039;s office for yourself. The room is small, cramped with a desk and chair against the far wall and a cabinet and chest by the door. Wooden shutters hang open on a narrow window, letting the midday sunlight inside.<br /><br />The desk is cluttered with papers. You shuffle through them, glancing over reports of the village&#039;s food supplies, a list of farms requesting a ward against necromancy, early plans for some upcoming festival, a note to check the health of some elderly villager... nothing you wouldn&#039;t expect from a village priest. The chest is held shut by a stout lock- Omo offers to try and smash it open, but that would hardly be a noble way to repay Eko&#039;s hospitality, even if you could manage it without rousing Ado and half the village with him. Instead, you open the cabinet- hanging inside are a set of clearly ceremonial robes and a short, ornately carved wooden staff. A brightly polished disk of metal serves as a mirror, casting your curious reflection back at you.<br /><br />Though you search everything twice, you fail to find any sort of secret compartment or hidden nook that might hold a diary, or journal, or any similarly incriminating evidence. Of course, it could very well be in the locked chest, but that&#039;s a problem for another time- right now, you&#039;re remembering that Omo mentioned a shelf of books in Eko&#039;s bedroom.<br /><br />The bedroom turns out to be a rather spartan affair. A chest of clothing stands open at the foot of a rumpled narrow bed tucked against one wall. A small table beside the bed holds an unlit candle, and what appears to be a flask similar to the one you saw Eko take with him when he left this morning. Your eyes are quickly drawn to a bookshelf on the wall near the door, half a dozen tomes of varying sizes filling the space.<br /><br />Moving closer, you inspect the titles of the books. Three fat books proclaim themselves to be different volumes of the <em>Chronicle of Thrimesdur: The Cremated Empire</em>, and a fourth book is titled simply <em>The Golgothan War</em>. One battered book is a copy of Joddo Meadtrust&#039;s <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em>, a book you yourself possess. You are surprised to see Meadtrust&#039;s name grace another, thinner book, titled <em>Line in the Sand: Discrete Forces and Interactions</em>. <em>A Study of Aloclesno</em> rests beside a thick, leather-bound book whose spine is worked with that square symbol Eko wears on a pendant- the cover of that book bears the same image, as well as the title <em>Atal: Shield of Atkilpeme</em>. <br /><br />Omo groans as your hand hovers over the books. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What, again with the reading?&quot;</span><br />You arch an eyebrow at him. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;And what&#039;s wrong with reading?&quot;</span><br />Omo waves at the shelf dismissively. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;If I wanted to spend all my time reading, I&#039;d have stayed in Yicelafo and become a Sage.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I&#039;m not asking <em>you</em> to read these books.&quot;</span> Reaching out, you snatch Joddo Meadtrust&#039;s second book as a likely starting point. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;If you don&#039;t want to hang around inside, then why don&#039;t you take a stroll around town? I&#039;m sure you can find something fun to do.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yeah, fun.&quot;</span> Omo snorts. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I don&#039;t think this town even has a tavern. Well, I suppose I&#039;ve never walked around a human village before. I&#039;ll go stretch my legs.&quot;</span><br /><br />As Omo sets off in search of more interesting sights, you settle into the fireside armchair in the kitchen, opening <em>Line in the Sand: Discrete Forces and Interactions</em>. Reading through the introduction and table of contents reveals that this is a book about Order Wards. Apparently, a Ward is any sort of &quot;bounded transitional interference field,&quot; which apparently means a protective barrier once you cut through the jargon describing what exactly they can do. There are wards that block sight and sound, wards that block movement, wards that can be used as traps... you make mental note of a ward that is supposed to shield your dreams, but ignore it for now in favor of the long list of wards against specific forms of Magic.<br /><br />As it turns out, a narrow ribbon already serves to bookmark the chapter about Necromancy wards. You flip past wards that raise an alarm when triggered by Necromancy (which apparently are not very Mana-intensive,) wards that can physically block the passage of the undead (which are much more costly,) and wards that can be used to destroy any undead that passes (which are extremely expensive, and complicated to cast judging by the walls of text and arcane diagrams accompanying them.) You find a description of a ward that sounds similar to what Eko said he used- it seems that it shields the presence of the living from undead by blocking Necromancy-based senses, and replacing them with a sense that the area is filled with inanimate objects, such that the undead creature in question would be unable to pass through.<br /><br />Unfortunately, you don&#039;t have a clue <em>how</em> it does all this- the technical explanation bears no relation to anything you are familiar with, and you can only assume that it makes sense to a practitioner of Order. It does seem to confirm what Eko said earlier, however- an unthinking creature would slightly alter their path to avoid an area protected by the ward in much the same way they would to avoid a particularly large boulder. It wouldn&#039;t work over too large an area, if a zombie was determined to move in a specific direction, but certainly it would be enough to prevent a zombie from trying to break in a window. A farmhouse would be just another large obstacle to go around, not a likely hiding place for victims. You don&#039;t even know if zombies can remember orders as complicated as recognizing a house to break and enter, though after your recent discovery you&#039;re not as sure.<br /><br />You snap the book shut when the dense text threatens to give you a headache. Between what you&#039;ve gleaned from this book, and the orders you found in the zombie&#039;s mind, it seems Eko is right- they shouldn&#039;t have crossed the ward on their own. Clearly they did just that, but you can&#039;t figure out how.<br /><br />You stretch, sinking back into the chair. That inquisition may have been fruitless, but you&#039;ve got plenty of daylight yet- maybe it&#039;s time for an experiment. The more you think about it, the more it seems that Necromancy must have some interaction with souls- otherwise, Balkoth would not have been able to make his soul-stealing forest monster. And it hardly seems possible to manipulate a soul if you can&#039;t <em>sense</em> it.<br /><br />Cautiously, you stick your head into the main room of the Temple. The children lie in exactly the position you saw them last- Ado Drunkenstumbles appears to be napping fitfully. Gliding over to your cot, you quietly sit on it, crossing your legs and leaning slightly toward where the children rest. Closing your eyes, you regulate your breathing, trying to center your thoughts. You try thinking about what the soul might be, the Spirit you vaguely remember the Sages mentioning as a child. You think about what it was like in the beginning, feeling that odd awareness of Vitality, feelings you now recognize to be early signs of your Necromancy manifesting itself. You bring your will to bear, trying to force those feelings to-<br /><br /><abbr title="1 MP"><strong><span style="font-size: 16pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">See Vitality</span></span></span></strong></abbr><br /><br />Your eyes open wide as you feel the spell resolve. To your eyes, Ado and the children suddenly resemble pulsing mounds of Vitality. You can see it flowing through them in rivers, branching streams spreading throughout their flesh, infusing every inch of them. In many ways, it looks like a zombie you&#039;re observing with your improved Necromantic Sight, except that the flow and interplay of Vitality is vastly more complicated. Squinting, you try to focus on the confusing jumble before you- you almost feel like you can detect internal organs, a powerful swirl that must be the heart, a rippling pulse...<br /><br />You frown. There is definitely a difference between Ado and the children- more than one. A frenzied, seething mass of Vitality around Ado&#039;s wound must be his body healing itself, possibly spurred on by whatever spell Eko cast. With this new, incredibly detailed spell, you can actually feel his Vitality growing in infinitesimal increments as he heals, increased by each pulse of his inner Vitality. The children, however, are definitely <em>not</em> healing. Oh, their Vitality pulses as well, but it seems more akin to water washing around a tub, while Ado feels like the ripples of water being poured <em>into</em> the tub.<br /><br />You silently rise to your feet, walking closer to Ado, fascinated by the pulsing of his Vitality. To your view, each surge seems to originate in the brain, flowing down toward the heart before surging to the rest of the body, swirling and lapping about. The brain itself seems to be a roiling mass of concentrated Vitality, expanding and contracting in time with the pulses. That mass of Vitality is convoluted beyond belief- only a subconscious suspicion makes you think it is organized and stable, rather than just a chaotic maelstrom.<br /><br />By comparison, the children&#039;s brains are much less interesting. There is no real concentration of Vitality, although the head does hold proportionally more than the rest of the body, much as it seems to in Ado. Further, the pulses of Vitality leaving the brain are weak, and seem to die out before reaching the body&#039;s extremities. A splash and a ripple compared to Ado&#039;s surging waves. You could almost call their Vitality sluggish, compared to Ado, though it still moves in patterns more intricate than any zombie you&#039;ve seen.<br /><br />Could that concentration of Vitality be the soul? It does seem to be the only major difference between Ado and the children, the only one you can&#039;t attribute to differences in age or general health, but...<br /><br />Abruptly, you come to a startling realization about what you are seeing. In your youth, back when your remarkable potential seemed sure to lead to a prestigious career as a Mage in Yicelafo, you were given lessons in rudimentary Life magic. Lessons you failed miserably, as you never displayed any aptitude for the art, only mastering the general spells available to all living creatures. One of the most basic spells you tried to learn, one of the first spells you <em>failed </em>to learn, was a more advanced version of Sense Vitality. The effects of that spell were supposed to be very like what you are seeing right now.<br /><br /><br />The afternoon is wearing on, and you&#039;re a little surprised that Eko hasn&#039;t returned yet. You&#039;re much less surprised that Omo hasn&#039;t either. What now?<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 10/11<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 7/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 24/35<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">80 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Headband, Belt Knife, <abbr title="1d6 damage, Slashing">Hatchet</abbr>, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr>, <abbr title="See detailed workings of Necromancy">Improved Necromantic Sight(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr>, <abbr title="can swim in calm, peaceful waters">Dabbling Swimmer</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Super grossed out<br /><strong>Twenty one</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - Detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - Causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - You can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><strong>Waterproof</strong>- 1MP/Hour duration - Makes an object non-absorbent.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br />- Trying to develop a destroy vitality spell, using the same principles of the steal vitality, except without keeping it usable. It might be possible to do it for cheaper or causing more damage for the same mana.<br />- Trying to use the principles of the destroy vitality or the steal vitality spell for a disinfectant spell. It will require a lot of fine control, but it should theoretically be possible.<br />- We could also try to overbuff a zombie. Is there a max to the amount of vitality a zombie can have? And what happens if a zombie gets a lot of vitality?<br />&nbsp;* Remove someone&#039;s soul. Try to store it for a time in a living thing like a tree, or confine it in a mana crystal, then put it back later. See if they&#039;re functional.<br />&nbsp;* Attempt to swap souls between two different bodies.<br />&nbsp;* Carefully attempt to displace our own soul from our own body. See if we can move around apart from our bodies, like astral projection. See if we can cast while in this state, enter other occupied bodies like a possession, then return to our body later.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Northwest Thrimesdur<br /><a href="http://tnypic.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Author&#039;s Note</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">HAHA!

I mean, even raising the dead is just basically shoving vitality into a dead body with an underlying line of command to it. That&#039;s why I like this and why I&#039;m glad to see it alive.<br /><br />The surges are interesting, especially where it seems concentrated and pulsing a lot around injuries as they heal. Could we move vitality around in someone&#039;s body to these injuries and increase the pulses/concentration of the vitality there to heal them faster? Maybe giving someone a burst of large surges could jumpstart someone, like the kids?<br /><br />Also, HOW THE HELL DID YOU FINISH THAT GAME?!

Ask him why he didn&#039;t warn the villagers. Tell him we found the zombie while exploring the temple. (We were curious about what was in the basement. We were curious about what was in those trapdoors because they looked like prison cells and we couldn&#039;t understand their purpose.) Tell him we understand the need to perform experiments, however that&#039;s no reason to keep his fellow villagers in the dark. If they knew, they could have better defended themselves.

Dismissing your See Vitality spell, you return to the fireside armchair to think about what you&#039;ve learned. You know Eko knew about nearby zombies before the attacks, but said nothing. You&#039;re pretty sure he&#039;s a Wizard and not a Necromancer, but it&#039;s still strange behavior. You know Eko has been concealing a zombie in the basement of an Order Temple, though how he got it down there is a mystery. You know (or at least guess) that he&#039;s been experimenting on that zombie. You know... he&#039;s been drinking a lot?<br /><br />Curious, you walk back to Eko&#039;s room. Snatching up the flask from the bedstand, you pop the lid off and carefully smell the contents. You are rewarded with the scent of pungent, bitter beer; Sewer Brew, if you had to guess. Not a popular beverage among the elves, but it was the drink of choice for many human Caravan guards since it was nearly as inexpensive as it was intoxicating. Maybe Eko is like Pevo, mixing his Mana potions with alcohol, but you don&#039;t really want to test that theory directly. Besides, you saw him drinking from a flask like this just this morning, not long after breakfast.<br /><br />You&#039;ve more than half a mind to investigate the forest further, but Eko is definitely keeping secrets. He might be able to provide more information if you confront him about it, and whether it&#039;s about the zombies or the forest, more information is a good thing. You resolve to do just that... after you find Omo. You don&#039;t think things will get violent, but prudence never hurt anyone.<br /><br />Setting the flask down, you grab your cloak and check your headband before hitting the streets of Bedscaled. You pause a moment on the temple steps as a brisk wind grabs at your cloak; a much stronger gust than the breezes you knew in Yicelafo. The Sun is bright in the sky, sinking toward evening, and the cloudless sky promises a starry night.<br /><br />You peer up and down the street, gathering your cloak and trying to deduce which way Omo might have gone. There really aren&#039;t many places of interest in the village itself: a blacksmith works his forge not too far away, another house advertises a carpenter&#039;s workshop around back, and a broad side street leads to the village well. No inns, no taverns, no places of song or dance or drink. It&#039;s the sort of pastoral scene that would have fit in Yicelafo with a few cosmetic changes, and not the sort of place Omo would seek out. On a hunch, you walk down the road to the East, where the villagers have been digging a defensive ditch.<br /><br />Up close, the ditch is quite impressive, as deep and wide as the shovels used to dig it. The bottom is quite muddy, a morass no attacker could easily escape. The dirt has been piled on the inside, forming a packed earthen wall to further slow invaders. The only break in the defense is the road leading east; a few heavy wagons stand ready to block the path, with extra barrels and bags of dirt to give the barricade extra weight. You can see that the ditch does not yet fully protect the village. Though the Northern end bends out of sight around the village, you can still see the Southern end of the ditch just short of making it&#039;s own Westward bend. You can also see the reason the South end of the project is not so far along as the North end.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;There we were, just outside the dark, haunted forest,&quot;</span> you hear Omo say as you approach his end of the ditch. Omo gestures expansively to his audience, half a dozen burly villagers leaning on their shovels. Another group of villagers continues the work of digging, but you can tell from their slow pace and turned heads that they&#039;re spending more time listening to Omo than they are working.<br /><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So I cracked him in the head with my staff, of course! I couldn&#039;t let a moldy old zombie stand between me and the children. But that&#039;s when I realized-&quot;</span> Omo cuts off in surprise when he sees you wave. Making hasty goodbyes and ignoring calls to finish his story, Omo walks over to join you.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Do you really think you should be distracting the ditch-diggers with your tales?&quot;</span> You ask dryly.<br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What?&quot;</span> Omo asks innocently. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I&#039;m keeping spirits up! We&#039;re practically heroes here; well, I am, anyway. I have to leave out most of the bits you did. They do think you&#039;re brave for coming with me, and the part where we flee the forest monster with the kids on our backs is a crowd pleaser.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Is it? How many people have you told this story?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Oh, I don&#039;t know. Everyone who asks, which is everyone I talk to for more than a minute. I can see why bards spend all their time telling stories; it&#039;s fun! And it&#039;s not like there&#039;s much else to do in this town. Did you finish your book?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I read what I wanted to.&quot;</span> You reply curtly, kicking at a clod of dirt. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;And now you and I are going to ask Eko some pointed questions about the you-know-what.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;The what? Oh!&quot;</span> Omo throws up his hands at your level stare. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What? That&#039;s nothing I want to dwell on. Are you sure confronting Eko is wise?&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I&#039;m sure it&#039;s the fastest way to get some solid information. I&#039;m tired of guesswork. As soon as he gets back, we ask him.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, you won&#039;t have to wait long.&quot;</span> Omo points down the road. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Looks like Eko&#039;s back.&quot;</span> <br /><br />Squinting, you can make out a robed figure making its way toward the village in the distance. Soon enough, you clearly recognize Eko Cleanvise walking with shoulders slumped and head down. He straightens up as he nears the village, running a hand over his balding head and settling authority over his shoulders like a cloak. He nods to the ditch-diggers, who ignore him as he walks by. You and Omo fall in on either side of him as you walk back toward the Temple.<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So... the wards all good?&quot;</span> You ask, fumbling for a way to broach the zombie in the basement.<br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yes, yes, no problems there. The village should have some warning if any zombies come this way.&quot;</span></span> Eko replies absently.<br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Great, great. Uh...&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Speaking of zombies, we found the one you&#039;ve got tied up in the basement.&quot;</span> Omo interjects.<br />Eko stumbles, biting back an oath as he anxiously looks to see if anyone is nearby. You have the road to yourselves, but Eko grabs each of you by the arm and pulls you in closer. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I&#039;m sorry, <em>what?</em>&quot;</span></span> Eko speaks quickly, and nervously. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You really want us to believe you don&#039;t know everything that goes on in your own Temple? Besides, we found your notes. Don&#039;t worry, we&#039;re not going to tell your secret to anybody.&quot;</span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Though maybe you should have told the villagers <em>before</em> the zombie attacks.&quot;</span> Omo says darkly. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Maybe you wouldn&#039;t have two orphans to care for in your Temple.&quot;</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I couldn&#039;t have known there was an attack coming!&quot;</span></span> Eko protests, frantically waving his arms. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I cast my divinations, and there wasn&#039;t another zombie around for miles! I thought it was just a straggler from the fight to the North. I did nothing wrong!&quot;</span></span> Eko begins fumbling his flask from beneath his robes, then pauses, his eyes narrowing suspiciously. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Wait... how did you know I found that zombie <em>before</em> the attacks?&quot;</span></span><br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 10/11<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 7/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 26/35<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">80 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Headband, Belt Knife, <abbr title="1d6 damage, Slashing">Hatchet</abbr>, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr>, <abbr title="See detailed workings of Necromancy">Improved Necromantic Sight(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr>, <abbr title="can swim in calm, peaceful waters">Dabbling Swimmer</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Nervous<br /><strong>Twenty one</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - Detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - Causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - You can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><strong>Waterproof</strong>- 1MP/Hour duration - Makes an object non-absorbent.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br />- Trying to develop a destroy vitality spell, using the same principles of the steal vitality, except without keeping it usable. It might be possible to do it for cheaper or causing more damage for the same mana.<br />- Trying to use the principles of the destroy vitality or the steal vitality spell for a disinfectant spell. It will require a lot of fine control, but it should theoretically be possible.<br />- We could also try to overbuff a zombie. Is there a max to the amount of vitality a zombie can have? And what happens if a zombie gets a lot of vitality?<br />&nbsp;* Remove someone&#039;s soul. Try to store it for a time in a living thing like a tree, or confine it in a mana crystal, then put it back later.

What were you doing on the first of Felsite?&quot;</span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Checking the wards, the same as I do to start every month. This was five days ago. Besides the wards on the farms and the forest itself, there is a certain monument near the boundary of Aloclesno, perhaps half an hour&#039;s walk north of the forest itself. An hour or two beyond the Scarletdaub farm.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;A monument?&quot;</span> Omo asks with visible interest.<br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></span> Eko nods. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It marks the site of a battle from the Golgothan War; well, a skirmish, anyway. It&#039;s the furthest West the Golgothans advanced before being thrown back. Anyway, the important thing is that the monument is protected by a ward, but when I went to check, there was a zombie on the <em>inside</em>.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;And you didn&#039;t tell anyone?&quot;</span> Omo questions.<br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Of course not!&quot;</span></span> Eko snaps. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;The strength of the Empire is based on Order magic. If I told the villagers that that magic had failed, so close to Aloclesno... it would have caused a panic! That sort of thing would spread far beyond this little village. No, I needed to learn how the zombie had come to be there, so I could explain to the villagers and put their minds at ease. I checked that there were no other zombies nearby, and then captured it.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;How did you manage that?&quot;</span> You ask curiously.<br />Eko sighs. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Cikul Scarletdaub helped me. He... was a good friend of mine. A little strange, to make his home so far from the village, so close to the forest, but brave and intelligent. He used to talk with me about the history of Thrimesdur, or some point of dogma or philosophy he&#039;d sunk his teeth into. More importantly, he was also... a free-thinker. Not as bound by tradition as most other villagers. When I explained what needed to be done, he helped me subdue the zombie and smuggle it into the village in his wagon.&quot;</span></span> Eko&#039;s voice becomes heavy with bitterness. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Cikul trusted me, and now he&#039;s dead. He&#039;s dead, and his wife and sisters are dead, and his only surviving family are soulless orphans.&quot;</span></span> He fumbles beneath his robes for his flask.<br />You cough into your hand delicately, breaking the awkward silence. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I still don&#039;t understand why you couldn&#039;t study the zombie openly. Why all the secrecy?&quot;</span><br />Eko takes a pull on his flask, then begins striding toward the Temple. You hurry to keep up. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I told you, there&#039;s a system to follow. As far as the Empire is concerned, anything you can&#039;t learn by Divination isn&#039;t worth learning. We&#039;re supposed to put our trust in Order. Besides, if the villagers learned the Divinations hadn&#039;t helped it would be almost as bad as learning the wards had failed in the first place.&quot;</span></span><br /><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You say you&#039;re supposed to put your trust in Order. But... <em>you</em> don&#039;t?&quot;</span><br />Eko gives you a sidelong glance, lowering his voice as a villager passes by. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;That&#039;s the kind of talk you should keep to yourself. Especially around our new visitors.&quot;</span></span> He adds meaningfully, nodding toward the Temple.<br /><br />You look ahead to the Temple. Evidently, in the short time you&#039;ve been gone a troop of soldiers has arrived in Bedscaled. A couple dozen cavalrymen are pitching their tents on the village green. A line of horses is tethered parallel to a side street, a pair of banners flying at their head. The larger banner bears an image of the divided square symbol Eko wears, the quadrants a checkerboard of black and white. The smaller banner hanging below it bears three red keys on a field of black.<br /><br />Several of the villagers passing by give the soldiers and the banners approving nods. The villagers who notice Eko coming give him a cool nod, if they acknowledge him at all. Eko scowls; after glancing at the soldiers on the green, he strides purposefully to the Temple door.<br /><br />Before he reaches the steps, the door swings open, revealing a heavily armored officer with a plumed helmet tucked under one arm. His already impressive height is accentuated by standing at the top of the stairs. The wind tugs at his long brown hair, making it stream to one side. Sharp brown eyes gaze from behind an impressive beak of a nose as he examines the soldiers. His face twists into a sneer when he notices Eko standing below him.<br /><br /><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;So, you are the priest who cannot cast a simple ward, yes? I am Bale Matchedstones the Murky Guises, Knight of Uzin the Umber Spine, Third Lieutenant tasked with the Second Cavalry of the Third Imperial Army. You will speak with me.&quot;</span></span> Without another word, he spins and reenters the Temple.<br /><br />Eko&#039;s face darkens angrily; you catch his sleeve as he climbs the stairs. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Who was that man, Eko?&quot;</span><br />Eko visibly bites back his anger. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Uzin is our god of war-making and vengeance, among other things. Ever since the Golgothan War, one of the responsibilities borne by Knights of Uzin is the destruction of Necromancers. It seems the Empire does not trust me to handle the situation; he is a specialist, and he outranks me.&quot;</span></span> Eko pulls away from you, then pauses, his voice quiet and gentle. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Tell him nothing about the basement. He would kill me for treason, and I couldn&#039;t say he was wrong to do so. But he may also harm you two, however inadvertent your involvement may have been, and that would be an injustice.&quot;</span></span> Squaring his shoulders, Eko grimly enters the Temple.<br /><br /><br />You stand back, regarding the Temple door, thinking what to do now. This Bale Matchedstones person seems dangerous, but he has no reason to suspect you, and it could be useful to know what abilities the Necromancer Hunters of Thrimesdur have at their disposal. You chew over Eko&#039;s story; if you have further questions for him, you can probably ask after he finishes meeting with Bale. You also consider your tentative plan to investigate Aloclesno, combing over Eko&#039;s words for anything that might change your plans. Your plans had been to make any excursion tomorrow morning, but if you want to dodge Bale entirely you could leave now, though it would be sunset by the time you reach the forest.<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 10/11<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 7/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 26/35<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">80 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Headband, Belt Knife, <abbr title="1d6 damage, Slashing">Hatchet</abbr>, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr>, <abbr title="See detailed workings of Necromancy">Improved Necromantic Sight(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr>, <abbr title="can swim in calm, peaceful waters">Dabbling Swimmer</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Nervous<br />6th Felsite, <strong>Twenty one</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - Detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - Causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - You can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><strong>Waterproof</strong>- 1MP/Hour duration - Makes an object non-absorbent.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br />- Trying to develop a destroy vitality spell, using the same principles of the steal vitality, except without keeping it usable. It might be possible to do it for cheaper or causing more damage for the same mana.<br />- Trying to use the principles of the destroy vitality or the steal vitality spell for a disinfectant spell. It will require a lot of fine control, but it should theoretically be possible.<br />- We could also try to overbuff a zombie. Is there a max to the amount of vitality a zombie can have? And what happens if a zombie gets a lot of vitality?<br />&nbsp;* Remove someone&#039;s soul. Try to store it for a time in a living thing like a tree, or confine it in a mana crystal, then put it back later. See if they&#039;re functional.<br />&nbsp;* Attempt to swap souls between two different bodies.<br />&nbsp;* Carefully attempt to displace our own soul from our own body. See if we can move around apart from our bodies, like astral projection. See if we can cast while in this state, enter other occupied bodies like a possession, then return to our body later.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Northwest Thrimesdur<br /><a href="http://tnypic.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Author&#039;s Note</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">Hooray, the game date is now measured the same way it is in my timeline!

Also maybe sand? did earth or fire like desert?<br />Each element was also associated with a species or two...<br />&nbsp;Air: Fairies and Giants<br />&nbsp;Chaos: Humans and animals<br />&nbsp;Death: Possibly humans or elves, they wore a lot of covering armour, also undead.<br />&nbsp;Earth: Dwarves and magically animated constructions<br />&nbsp;Fire: giants and humans<br />&nbsp;Life: elves and supernatural animals<br />&nbsp;Order: Humans and a very small number of highly respected undead, things like &quot;Arthur shall return to Camelot in its time of need&quot; even though everyone saw Arthur die...<br />&nbsp;Water: Amazons and, umm, did they have lizardfolk?<br />Magical themes also exist.<br />&nbsp;Air: ummmm... dunno<br />&nbsp;Chaos: Possibly area effects.<br />&nbsp;Death: Curses and undead mostly.<br />&nbsp;Earth: Probably protection and terrain.<br />&nbsp;Fire: Massive obscene damage, often with fine print...<br />&nbsp;Life: Typically healing<br />&nbsp;Order: Buff spells<br />&nbsp;Water: forget...<br />Elements also had oppositions:<br />&nbsp;Air &lt;-&gt; Earth<br />&nbsp;Chaos &lt;-&gt; Order<br />&nbsp;Death &lt;-&gt; Life<br />&nbsp;Fire &lt;-&gt; Water<br /></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just because I really liked Lords of Magic, I&#039;ll elaborate that Air had Snow instead of Mountain (though they didn&#039;t slow down in Mountain,) Life and Water had Meadows instead of Plains (and were slowed by Sand, annoying for Water since that&#039;s what all the beaches were,) I think Death was dark elves and humans, Water did indeed have mainly lizardfolk armies, Air used a lot of travel and scrying magic (along with sweet Lightning powers,) Chaos magic was lolrandom (some sweet polymorph abilities though,) and Water had a little bit of everything (with a splash of &quot;fuck fire&quot; specialties.) Death had good damage dealing abilities, curses (including that one nasty infectious stat rot thing) and of course, the ability to raise skeletons/zombies/shades which could snowball quickly (including one notable scenario where that was your only way to raise an army while murdering scattered Elven militia.)<br /><br />Having said that, I will note that while I did take the Element Wheel and some aesthetics from that game, the good/evil mechanic specifically and magic spells in general didn&#039;t carry over to this game. This game arose out of putting some deeper thought into how the mechanics of magic might work for each faith, which lead to some significant deviations from how they worked in Lords of Magic. Originally, this game was going to offer a choice between playing as a Necromancer, Chaos Shaman, or Water Mage, but the other inspirations I mentioned in the OP led to worldbuilding, which in turn made the Necromancer the most interesting story for me to write.<br /><br />As long as I&#039;m rambling about inspirations, Erfworld was what made me start thinking about how Necromancy would work, mechanically, since the PoV character at the time was a Necromancer who spent a fair amount of time musing about her trade. I arrived at different conclusions, but that&#039;s what got the ball rolling. DF mostly inspired me in the same general way it inspires everything I do, and is a ready source for randomly generated names and the like; DF has inspired me in some specific ways with this game, but we&#039;re not there yet, and it&#039;s not anything you&#039;d see in DF directly anyway.</div>

If the zombies were controlled by Nightroar himself (or one of his lackeys if he has any) they could have been ordered to go through the wards.Info about their methods.

He said he talked about philosophy with his friend, so why not talk a bit about philosophy/ethics/what&#039;s right or wrong with him. He said that he didn&#039;t follow procedure. Does he believe that the higher ups are wrong and that Order may not be the only way to learn about or fight the enemy? Does he have doubts about his role as a priest? Does he believe there&#039;s more he could do if he wasn&#039;t restricted by the rules of the priests?

(The death question is asked in the end so that it doesn&#039;t arouse suspicion but merely sounds like a logical conclusion to a talk about gods of other magical schools.)<br />As an extension to the above question, we could ask whether or not gods actively participate in the events of the world and perform miracles and if yes, whether or not a death god could be weakening order magic and causing their wards to fail.Can he tell us more about Order gods? They seem like something any human of the empire would know about, so we should at least know the names and what they are gods of (war, peace, law, etc.).<br />Life magic has three schools.

On the one hand, Bale Matchedstones certainly possesses knowledge that could be useful to you, and you&#039;re interested in the techniques of Necromancer-Hunters. On the other hand, he <em>is </em>a hunter of Necromancers, and you are a Necromancer yourself. There is undeniably an element of risk involved with associating with the Knight. Besides, he doesn&#039;t seem like a very friendly individual; hopefully Eko will tell you everything you need to know.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Moving down the street a ways, you spend some time watching the soldiers make camp. The tents are arrayed in neat rows, and it seems each tent holds three or four soldiers; it is hard to get good count, as they scurry around the village green like overambitious ants. Each tent is quickly accompanied by a small campfire, as well as a standing circle of steel-tipped lances and swords in oiled scabbards, close at hand in case of sudden attack. As soon as fires are lit, the soldiers begin fetching water and pulling rations out of their packs, preparing an evening meal. More than one village goodwife wanders over with baskets of bread or vegetables, which the soldiers receive with fervent thanks.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You watch with interest as several soldiers erect a much larger tent in the middle of the formation. You would have thought Bale would stay in the Temple, or some house with a free bed, but it appears he means to bed down with his men. No sooner are the banners transferred to a tall pole just outside that tent than Bale himself emerges from the Temple, striding into his tent with no acknowledgement of either the goodwives or his soldiers, though both groups give respectful nods and salutes.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Stepping quickly, you return to the Temple. The children lie as you last saw them, unmoved in their cots. The other cots have been dragged around Ado Drunkenstumbles, and a small gaggle of men, women, and children surround him, talking animatedly. It appears they are friends or family come to visit the dour man. Ado very nearly smiles at the youngest child as she tugs on her mother&#039;s skirt. You quietly slip past the reunion, and find Eko vigorously stirring a pot in the kitchen. He looks up as you enter, a glower fading from his face.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Ah, there you are. Ado&#039;s kin brought some chicken stew.&quot;</span></span> Rummaging through one of the cabinets, Eko pulls out some bowls and spoons and begins filling them. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It&#039;s quite good, much better than what we ate yesterday. Dana is an excellent cook.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You thank Eko as you accept one of the bowls and a piece of bread, sitting at the table to eat. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So, what&#039;s the news? How goes the war?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Did you get fired?&quot;</span> Omo asks bluntly, sitting down on the other side of the table with his own bowl.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko snorts as he settles into the armchair by the fire, resting a bowl of stew on his knee. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It is not Bale&#039;s place to relieve me of my duties as priest, but his presence does mean he takes precedence in all matters related to the undead attacks. His men will help fortify the village defenses tonight, and tomorrow he will begin scouting for any undead forces in the area. As far as the war effort goes, little has happened. The Necromancer has not been sighted on either the Eastern or Western fronts, though sporadic attacks continue to emerge from the lands he controls. We&#039;re prepared now, and the raids don&#039;t accomplish much. He&#039;s just throwing away bodies.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;How do you know what&#039;s going on on the other side of his army?&quot;</span> Omo asks around a mouthful of stew. He&#039;s already halfway through the bowl!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Communication between Wizards is a simple matter. The Emperor&#039;s will is known throughout Thrimesdur as soon as he makes it known; it could hardly be otherwise.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;And what <em>is </em>the Emperor&#039;s will?&quot;</span> You ask quietly. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Are there any plans to attack Curo Nightroar? What about the Necromancer on the Jeweled Coast? Has the Empire asked for aid from the elves, or the dwarves?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko shakes his head. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Things like that are not for a common country priest to know. I expect that campaigning will begin in earnest now that spring is well and truly here, and armies have had a chance to marshal. Supposedly there&#039;s quite a large army at Atkilpeme, the capital. The dwarves are nearly as reclusive as the elves, but with a threat of this magnitude I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the diplomats have been working on some sort of agreement. I don&#039;t know that, I&#039;m just guessing. I expect you could tell me more of the elves than I know.&quot;</span></span> He says, giving you a meaningful glance.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;When we left Yicelafo they were preparing for a defensive war, in case you lot were defeated.&quot;</span> Omo replies, idly scraping his bread through a mostly empty bowl. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It sounded like we were going to send an envoy of some kind, but I don&#039;t know what they were supposed to say, or offer.&quot;</span> Omo perks up happily as Eko serves him another ladleful of the hearty stew; it really is quite good.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Eko,&quot;</span> You ask slowly, <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I&#039;ve been thinking. Exactly what magical faiths have examined the victims of Aloclesno?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko runs a hand through his thinning hair. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, Order Wizards were the first, obviously, but all they could do was identify the root problem. Not long after the Golgothan War there was another child who wandered into the forest, and was recovered comatose. He was taken to the Elves in Yicelafo; they could do nothing more for him, I&#039;m afraid, and his body lived on for years. It was after that incident that the policy of allowing the victims to die after a month was enacted.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You wave your spoon at Eko. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;That&#039;s one of the things I was wondering; I distinctly recall one of the Sages saying that any undead creature made during the Golgothan War couldn&#039;t possibly last this long.&quot;</span><br />Eko shrugs. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;This did happen only a few years after the Golgothan War, before the magnitude of the curse was well known. Perhaps they did not check up on the state of the curse. I will also say that the nature of the curse is still something of a mystery, and was even more unknown back then. The idea that the curse is some kind of Necromantic creature is still somewhat controversial, as no reliable witness has ever encountered it.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;No <em>reliable</em> witness?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yes. There are more than a few accounts from frightened soldiers in Girus&#039;s army, but none of them agree other than mention of a zombie&#039;s fiery purple eyes, an easy fabrication for any soldier with experience fighting the undead. There are also many accounts by simple villagers and farmers that mention the eyes, a detail they are less likely to invent; however, there are also many more accounts that describe red or yellow eyes instead, and the size of the creature ranges from a large wolf to a cave bear. No priests, Wizards, officers or public officials of any kind have reported anything that would indicate a physical creature. Did you see anything while you were in the forest?&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You slowly take a bite of stew, pondering your reply. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Nothing definite, no. I got the sense there was a creature there, but I didn&#039;t see it clearly.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Interesting.&quot;</span></span> Eko cleans his bowl with his bread, sighing happily. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I&#039;ve always favored the Monster theory, myself. The accounts that mention purple eyes all match one another reasonably closely. The other stories are no doubt fakes or exaggerations.&quot;</span></span> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You mentioned possessing spells that can detect the undead at a distance. Has anyone ever tried scrying on the forest?&quot;</span> You ask.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko nods. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yes, several times. Nothing has ever been found, though at one time or another the entire forest has been subject to divinations. It&#039;s the biggest knock against that theory. There have been discussions about attempting to scry on the entire forest at once, to finally settle the question, but it would take a great number of Wizards to accomplish, and many of them would need to be of higher ability than your average priest. Nobody considers it worth the effort, as simple precautions have proven effective.&quot;</span></span> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What about ghosts, or wraiths, or something like that? Those stories sound like they could be disembodied souls, to me. Could they be the monster of Aloclesno?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko sets his bowl aside, frowning in thought. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It&#039;s an interesting idea. There&#039;s a wide variety of phantasms like that. Some of them are loose souls bent to an evil purpose, as you guessed, but many of them are just ethereal creatures. Most of those stories involve the spirit looking for a body to possess; I&#039;ve never heard a story about a ghost destroying a soul but leaving the body intact and unharmed. They either destroy you, or they don&#039;t. This peculiar half-death is unique to Aloclesno.&quot;</span></span> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Is it something that Balkoth could have made?&quot;</span> You ask eagerly, moving to set your bowl on a cluttered countertop.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I don&#039;t know.&quot;</span></span> Eko replies slowly. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I believe so. I have not made an extensive study of the Golgothan War, but I think I read something about shades fighting for the Golgothans on the Eastern Front. From what I recall, they had no soul-stealing capabilities, but they were quite effective weapons until they were repulsed by the Wizards. It&#039;s difficult to know what Balkoth was capable of; he was the most accomplished Necromancer in the world, at the height of Golgotha&#039;s power.&quot;</span></span> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;How was Balkoth defeated, anyway?&quot;</span> You ask as you pull your chair closer to the fire.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko grins wryly. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What, you don&#039;t know the story? I thought every elf would know.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;She should know, if she had paid attention as a child.&quot;</span> Omo offers, making a dogged attempt to clean his second bowl of stew. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;They told the story often enough.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, the short version is that a group of fearsome warriors set out to kill Balkoth himself. They were a symbol of the unity of the Alliance, and the represented the best each member had to offer. Thrimesdur gave the services of a Knight of Uzin. The Earth Kingdom sent the King&#039;s Champion himself, a dwarf skilled in all manner of fighting. The most powerful Water Mystic of the Jeweled Coast lent her arcane spells, and was accompanied by her Lizardman bodyguard. A Pixie Lord from the mountain tribes gave his deadly skill with blade and rapier. One of the last living Life Masters was there as well; some say he was the most powerful left alive after the Sacred Grove was razed. There was even a Chaos Shaman there.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So many?&quot;</span> You say, surprised. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I had thought it would be a smaller group.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko shrugs. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;The alliance was large, and for a mission this audacious they turned away no one. I understand the full group didn&#039;t even make it to Balkoth himself; they had to sneak their way into territory held tightly by the Golgothans, to the Great Temple of Death itself, then fight their way past fanatical bodyguards before they could personally face the most powerful Necromancer in the world. They won, of course. Sorry, I&#039;m not much of a storyteller.&quot;</span></span> Omo snorts in the corner of the room.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Why did they have to go to the Golgothan Great Temple?&quot;</span> You ask, confused. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Why not confront him in battle, while he was campaigning? Why didn&#039;t they force the fight someplace hostile to Balkoth, instead of the heart of his power?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko grins wryly. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Eh, I don&#039;t recall. I know I have a book on the subject, though I don&#039;t remember if a reason is given. It&#039;s more of a story and less of a history, I&#039;m afraid.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I see.&quot;</span> You lean back in your chair, gazing into the fire. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I&#039;m sorry, I seem to have strayed quite far from my original question. You called on the Life Mages to try and heal the victims of Aloclesno. Who else? I&#039;ve read that Fire magic is linked with the soul.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko nods. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I have also been taught that, but sadly Fire Invokers are rare, now that the Fire Giants are exterminated. I&#039;ve heard some dwarves practice that Faith, but they&#039;ve never examined a victim.</span></span> Eko leans back, thinking. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">By chance an Earth Magician was near a victim about, oh, three hundred and fifty years ago; he agreed to examine the victim, but found nothing. Not surprising; Earth Magicians aren&#039;t very good at healing much beyond broken bones. Several Water Mystics have attempted to treat the victims, but also fell short of the task. That leaves what, Air? Not many of that Faith wandering Urak any more.&quot;</span></span> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What about a Chaos Shaman?&quot;</span> You ask curiously.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko snorts. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What <em>about </em>Chaos Shaman? They aren&#039;t welcome in Thrimesdur, and even if somebody took a victim to them, and they were willing to help, I doubt they have any special facility in matters of the soul.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You nod, sitting silently for a time, trying to think how to broach your next question. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Eko... did you learn anything? In the basement?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko glowers at the fire, fishing his flask from beneath his robes. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Everything, and nothing. Every spell worked exactly as intended. My wards, my divinations... they worked perfectly. Oh, I couldn&#039;t detect its thoughts, but they&#039;re not supposed to have any; those spells failed as they should have. But for the rest... I have no idea how that zombie got past the wards.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The silence stretches while Eko drinks. You cast around for a change of subject. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So... Thrimesdur has two gods, then?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko looks at you in surprise, tucking away his flask. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Far more than that. You elves worship only one?&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Not even that many.&quot;</span> Omo says, stretching in the corner. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We venerate the spirit of the Walled Jungle, but I wouldn&#039;t call it worship. Just respect for something larger than ourselves.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko shakes his head. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You are unlike what I expected. How can you be so ignorant? It has been a thousand years since the Golgothan War ended.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;A much shorter time for our people.&quot;</span> You say defensively. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We don&#039;t like to travel much. The world is a dangerous place, and we are few.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It does not take very long to visit a library.&quot;</span></span> Eko says curtly. He sighs, raising his hands. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I meant no offense. Thrimesdur has four chief gods of Order, as well as a multitude of lesser deities and spirits who array themselves in one pantheon or another. Uzin the Umber Spine is the god of Springtime and planting, as well as luck, aggressive war, and righteous retribution. His worship is common among soldiers, and Uzin&#039;s Day is celebrated when Winter turns to Spring. Atal would be the principle god as patron of the Emperor, though Atal is not any more or less revered than the other major gods. He is typically associated with civilization and the sun, as well as protection, justice and Summer, and the Festival of Atal will be mark the beginning of Summer. Not that far off, now. Resmi Beachnights is the goddess of the Autumn and the harvest, as well as marriage, secrecy, and the hunt. The Feast of Resmi is celebrated at harvest time across the Empire. Finally, Shezpa the Lens of Scribing is the goddess of crafts and Winter, as well as knowledge, darkness, magic, and honesty. Winternight is celebrated in her honor at the solstice, a day for friends to enjoy what good they have in the heart of winter and a night for quiet contemplation.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;And there are even more gods below them? Do all faiths have so many?&quot;</span> You ask.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko shifts in his chair, settling into a more comfortable position. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yes, yes. I would be awake all night and all day tomorrow trying to familiarize you with all of Thrimesdur&#039;s gods. I&#039;m fuzzy on some of the more obscure deities myself. I haven&#039;t made a study of foreign religions, but I know that the cities on the Jeweled Coast worship a wide variety of gods from across the world. The Horse-Lords have their own barbaric spirits they pray to, and... well, I don&#039;t know much about the Dwarven gods. I have heard of Ral Nourishedblankets the Citadel of Towers, who must be their chief deity, but I know little else.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So many gods in the world, and none for the elves.&quot;</span> You say, amused.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Oh, I&#039;m sure there must be gods and spirits strongly associated with Life.&quot;</span></span> Eko interjects quickly. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Perhaps they are weak for lack of worship, or perhaps they do not seek out worshippers, but they must be there. Every nation has a shepherd, whether you know them or not.&quot;</span></span> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;And your shepherds keep you from learning about your ancient foe. The magic you rely on has failed.&quot;</span> You reply solemnly.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;The magic has not failed; the wards held in the basement. The failing must be within me.&quot;</span> </span>Eko says stubbornly. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;And the prohibition related to the capture of undead is based in dogma, not the direct word of any god.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;And you think this dogma is wrong.&quot;</span> You say.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko visibly struggles with himself. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It isn&#039;t <em>wrong</em>... there is reason for it. It prevents temptation.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Temptation?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko runs a hand through his hair, grimacing. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;To abandon Order. To discard the force that holds the Empire together. To step outside your <em>purpose</em>. Wizards cast spells. Armies send scouts. Both tasks have their place, and both tasks should be carried out by those most qualified to perform them. Stepping out of your role... if I wanted to cast spells <em>and </em>go adventuring, I should have signed up to be a Knight and received the proper training.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;And are you tempted to knighthood?&quot;</span> You ask softly.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko sighs, remaining silent. You watch the fire burn low together. Omo snores softly in the corner, face down on the table. Well, he starts out snoring softly, but soon begins to emit noises resembling those of some sort of wild beast.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Wake up, Omo.&quot;</span> You say, poking him in the head.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Hm what?&quot;</span> He asks groggily. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Why?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It&#039;s time to go to sleep.&quot;</span> You say, working out a kink in your back as you stand.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Omo groans. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I <em>was </em>asleep, you hateful woman.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It&#039;s time to go to bed, then. We have a busy day tomorrow.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We do? Doing what?&quot;</span><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s a fair question. You had planned to begin a more thorough investigation of the forest, but you&#039;ve received a lot of information to ponder. If that is your intention, then you should begin thinking how to spend your day tomorrow; to go straight into the forest, or to try something else on the outskirts first? How do you plan to attack this problem, if you still wish to tackle it?<br /><br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 10/11<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 7/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 26/35<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">80 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Headband, Belt Knife, <abbr title="1d6 damage, Slashing">Hatchet</abbr>, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr>, <abbr title="See detailed workings of Necromancy">Improved Necromantic Sight(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr>, <abbr title="can swim in calm, peaceful waters">Dabbling Swimmer</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Pondering<br />6th Felsite, <strong>Twenty one</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - Detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - Causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - You can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><strong>Waterproof</strong>- 1MP/Hour duration - Makes an object non-absorbent.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br />- Trying to develop a destroy vitality spell, using the same principles of the steal vitality, except without keeping it usable. It might be possible to do it for cheaper or causing more damage for the same mana.<br />- Trying to use the principles of the destroy vitality or the steal vitality spell for a disinfectant spell. It will require a lot of fine control, but it should theoretically be possible.<br />- We could also try to overbuff a zombie. Is there a max to the amount of vitality a zombie can have? And what happens if a zombie gets a lot of vitality?<br />&nbsp;* Remove someone&#039;s soul. Try to store it for a time in a living thing like a tree, or confine it in a mana crystal, then put it back later. See if they&#039;re functional.<br />&nbsp;* Attempt to swap souls between two different bodies.<br />&nbsp;* Carefully attempt to displace our own soul from our own body. See if we can move around apart from our bodies, like astral projection. See if we can cast while in this state, enter other occupied bodies like a possession, then return to our body later.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Northwest Thrimesdur<br /><a href="http://tnypic.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Author&#039;s Note</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">Monk12 casts Level Three Wall of Text!

After much inner debate, you nod decisively. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;In the morning, we&#039;ll go back to the forest. I think there&#039;s a creature there, and I think we are uniquely suited to destroy it.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Omo nods sleepily, standing up from the table. Eko&#039;s eyes positively bulge out. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You&#039;re going to do <em>what?</em>&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Omo shrugs. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We&#039;ll destroy that whatever-it-is for you. Shouldn&#039;t be a big deal.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Shouldn&#039;t... <em>shouldn&#039;t be a big deal?</em>&quot;</span></span> Eko splutters. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It&#039;s an ancient soul-destroying monstrosity! Nobody is sure it&#039;s even a physical creature, and you think you can <em>kill</em> it?&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Has anyone ever tried before?&quot;</span> You ask, curious.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko puts a hand to his face, drawing a deep breath. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Several times, yes. Mostly villagers who couldn&#039;t accept the fate of their loved ones, and one priest who didn&#039;t find anything. That priest did well for himself, too, since most of the other fools who tried wound up <em>dead!</em>&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;A priest tried? What happened?&quot;</span> You ask, perking up. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Why didn&#039;t you mention this earlier? An eyewitness account would be very useful.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;He never saw any monster, though he did make it further into the forest than anyone since the Golgothan War.&quot;</span></span> Eko says slowly, looking from you to Omo and back again. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You&#039;re serious, aren&#039;t you. You&#039;re going to try and <em>kill </em>the Curse of Aloclesno. Why? There&#039;s nothing to be done for the children; they&#039;re as good as dead. There&#039;s nothing for you to gain by doing this. The curse only afflicts those who step within Aloclesno. Why risk your lives?&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Omo frowns. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So we should do what, ignore it? Let some other fool kid walk in and die in a hundred years or so? Maybe that&#039;s a long time for you, but I intend to still be alive when that happens, and for the century after that, and the century after that. That&#039;s a lot of dead children in my lifetime that I could have saved.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We&#039;ll be careful.&quot;</span> You say simply. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We&#039;ll do things methodically, and if all goes well we&#039;ll have it taken care of before anything untoward happens. Of course, things are more likely to go well if we prepare carefully. Can you tell us what that adventurous priest did that kept him alive in the heart of Aloclesno?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko gazes at you silently for a long moment, running a hand through his thin hair. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I... have a book on the subject. <em>A Study of Aloclesno</em>. Most of what I know comes from that book; I&#039;ll mark the relevant passage for you in the morning.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You mean I can take it with me?&quot;</span> You ask, surprised.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko nods, standing up. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Good night. I&#039;ll see you tomorrow.&quot;</span></span><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You sleep quite soundly, and wake shortly after dawn feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. Surprisingly, you find that Omo woke up before you; he&#039;s taken the bandage off of his arm, and smiles in satisfaction at how well the wound healed. It seems you are both fully recovered from your scuffle outside Aloclesno.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You step into Eko&#039;s living room for some breakfast, and stop, surprised. Eko is also awake, and dressed for traveling with a simple brown wool cloak and a backpack. In his left hand he holds a book, and in his right hand he holds a short spear with red and green tassels; you recognize it as the one you saw hanging in the basement.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko smiles happily. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Good morning! I&#039;ve prepared some trail rations; I thought we should eat breakfast on the road in order to maximize daylight. I don&#039;t fancy fighting a soul-sucking monstrosity in the dark.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We?&quot;</span> You ask cautiously. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We didn&#039;t ask you to come yourself. You have an important job to do for Bedscaled, maintaining the wards.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko scratches his head, suddenly seeming uncertain. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well... the wards should be fine for days without my supervision. Weeks, even. Bale is in charge of hunting the zombies that attacked the other night, and he was quite clear he neither needed nor wanted my help finding them. He&#039;s also taken on organizing the defense of the village, so they don&#039;t need me for that. So, I could spend my time on administrative work preparing for a festival we may never have... or I could go to the forest with you.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You seemed to think we were suicidal to even try.&quot;</span> Omo says bluntly. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Now you want to join us?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko sighs. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Nym... you asked whether I was tempted to knighthood last night. Well, maybe the life of a knight is beyond me, but I do think I made a mistake somewhere along the line, or my life wouldn&#039;t have lead me here. Maybe it&#039;s not too late to make the right choice.&quot;</span></span><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You brush your hair back, thinking furiously. True, a trained Order Wizard might be able to help you in the forest, but your plan for dealing with the creature in the forest is largely based on your ability to control or destroy it with Necromancy. Should you refuse Eko? If so, what excuse can you give that will keep him from just following you?<br /><br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 11/11<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 12/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 26/35<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">80 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Headband, Belt Knife, <abbr title="1d6 damage, Slashing">Hatchet</abbr>, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr>, <abbr title="See detailed workings of Necromancy">Improved Necromantic Sight(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr>, <abbr title="can swim in calm, peaceful waters">Dabbling Swimmer</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Cautious<br />7th Felsite, <strong>Twenty two</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - Detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - Causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - You can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><strong>Waterproof</strong>- 1MP/Hour duration - Makes an object non-absorbent.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br />- Trying to develop a destroy vitality spell, using the same principles of the steal vitality, except without keeping it usable. It might be possible to do it for cheaper or causing more damage for the same mana.<br />- Trying to use the principles of the destroy vitality or the steal vitality spell for a disinfectant spell. It will require a lot of fine control, but it should theoretically be possible.<br />- We could also try to overbuff a zombie. Is there a max to the amount of vitality a zombie can have? And what happens if a zombie gets a lot of vitality?<br />&nbsp;* Remove someone&#039;s soul. Try to store it for a time in a living thing like a tree, or confine it in a mana crystal, then put it back later. See if they&#039;re functional.<br />&nbsp;* Attempt to swap souls between two different bodies.<br />&nbsp;* Carefully attempt to displace our own soul from our own body. See if we can move around apart from our bodies, like astral projection. See if we can cast while in this state, enter other occupied bodies like a possession, then return to our body later.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Northwest Thrimesdur<br /><a href="http://tnypic.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Author&#039;s Note</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">Damn!

Thus far, Order magic has only proven incapable of <em>discovering </em>the creature. Eko had this to say when you questioned him about what spells he could cast himself:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: 2-14</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Um... your wards only block sight, right?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;That&#039;s right.&quot;</span> Eko nods.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Can they do anything else? Can they actually block the zombies, or raise an alarm?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Sufficiently powerful wards could, yes. The strongest wards I can cast would not do much other than slow down the undead for a time, and would take me some time to cast in the first place. The only reason I haven&#039;t cast more powerful wards is because they are quite mana-intensive; before the zombies there was no need for stronger wards, and now I must reserve a portion of my mana in case it is needed to repel an attack.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You blink in surprise. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Your magic can repel zombies?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;If it comes to that. I specialize in defensive wards, but no Wizard situated near the haunted forest can serve without knowing some specialty spells. Undead are an aberration from the natural order- it stand to reason a Wizard can restore it.&quot;</span> Eko shrugs. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I don&#039;t know how effective I can be- more likely I will need the mana for healing spells. Either way, I cannot overexert myself in good conscience.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You blink in surprise. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Oh. Well, your wards- can they repel loose souls?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Your concern for the children is touching, but no, their souls are not trapped in the forest by my wards, if that&#039;s what you are getting at. I do know wards for protection against spirits and ghosts, but none of those are in place around the forest. And remember, there were many victims before it was thought needful to ward the forest- they lay comatose for years, but never recovered.&quot;</span><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You also have an idea of his failings in other branches of Order magic from a later conversation.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: 2-19</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Divinations?&quot;</span> You ask.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yes. They are Order spells to observe and analyze; they&#039;ve never been my strong suit.

He used to talk with me about the history of Thrimesdur, or some point of dogma or philosophy he&#039;d sunk his teeth into. More importantly, he was also... a free-thinker. Not as bound by tradition as most other villagers. When I explained what needed to be done, he helped me subdue the zombie and smuggle it into the village in his wagon.&quot;</span> Eko&#039;s voice becomes heavy with bitterness. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Cikul trusted me, and now he&#039;s dead.

He doesn&#039;t like it, but he doesn&#039;t really like <em>me </em>either, so there&#039;s no harm done.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;And the children are cared for?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yes, I&#039;ve made arrangements. What, did you think I would just abandon them?&quot;</span></span> Eko says, exasperated. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Despite popular opinion, I can manage my own affairs. Are we going to spend all morning talking, or are we going to the forest?&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You nod. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Very well, then. Welcome aboard, Eko.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Omo coughs into his hand, shooting you a meaningful glance. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Ah, Nym, is this a good idea? You know, all things considered?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You ignore Eko&#039;s curious glance. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It&#039;ll be fine, Omo. Let&#039;s get moving.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko smiles, leading the way to the door. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Finally! If we&#039;re going to do this fool thing, we&#039;d better be about it.&quot;</span></span><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You quickly pass out of the temple and into the streets of Bedscaled. Several villagers bustle about in the early morning light, most of them fetching water from the well. The soldier&#039;s camp is also active; it&#039;s difficult to get a good count, but Omo assures you that several soldiers and horses are absent, probably on some mission or other. Eko doesn&#039;t break his stride as he heads for the edge of town, despite receiving several odd looks for his traveling garb and his spear.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s a beautiful day for a hike. The sun shines bright and hot in a cloudless sky, and a warm breeze from the west blows at your back. You had been a little worried that the portly priest would slow you down, but Eko sets a ground-eating pace, easily keeping up with your longer stride. Once you&#039;ve put the village and farms well behind you, you slow down a bit to eat Eko&#039;s breakfast rations; a hard bread with some kind of nut baked inside, and some creamy cheese to go with it.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So, Eko...&quot;</span> You begin, breaking the silence. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What do you think about all the Necromancers that have been popping up lately?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Omo rolls his eyes behind Eko&#039;s back. Eko frowns, munching on his bread. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What do you mean by that? War and strife, pain and death; it is what always happens when Necromancers arise.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yes, but why do you think that is?&quot;</span> You ask. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Why do they always go on conquering sprees? It&#039;s a question I asked the Sages before leaving Yicelafo, and they did not know the answer. What do you think?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko shrugs. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, just as humans are born with the spark of Order because they have the favor of one god or another, so too are Necromancers born with their spark because of the favor of dark Death gods. And just as humans use their spark to become Wizards and priests in accordance with the will of the gods of Order, so do Necromancers spread death and destruction at the urging of whatever dark gods they worship.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Necromancer gods?&quot;</span> You ask interestedly. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What do you know about them?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko finishes the last of his cheese and bread, shaking his head. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Not much, off the top of my head. They&#039;re all dead, now that their worshipers are destroyed. Supposedly, that is the reason Necromancers spend so much time fighting and conquering; the death they cause strengthens the god that empowers them, and if they ever gained their own kingdoms and followers they could establish Temples to Death, which would revive those gods.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So that&#039;s why Thrimesdur suppresses Necromancy so harshly? To keep the Death gods from returning?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko shrugs. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, that, and the prophecies.&quot;</span></span> He sighs as you exchange a blank look with Omo. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Right. Elves. Of course you don&#039;t know the prophecies. Well. Alright... one of the main schools of Order magic is Divinations, and the most powerful and arcane spells of that school relate to predicting the future. Shortly after the Golgothan War, the Imperial Archmage was called to make a Prophecy, to guide the Empire after the devastation of the war. The Archmage was one of the most powerful Wizards to ever hold that title, and he made a series of prophecies to govern the actions of the Empire and the Order of Wizards. One of those prophecies says that the last Emperor of Thrimesdur will be slain by Necromancy; not in those words, of course, but I forget the exact verse.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;The Emperor will be killed by a Necromancer? Wouldn&#039;t that just make somebody else Emperor?&quot;</span> Omo asks skeptically.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko shakes his head. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;No, it&#039;s very clear that this will be the <em>last </em>Emperor of Thrimesdur. His death marks the end of the Empire. And it&#039;s more troubling than that; prophecies made at the very founding of the Empire say that when the Empire finally falters, a great cataclysm will befall all of Urak. Many scholars have spent their lives analyzing and correlating the various prophecies of Thrimesdur, and while some passages are open to interpretation, these prophecies in particular seem clear. Necromancy will destroy the Empire and the world, and while it&#039;s unclear whether the former will lead directly to the latter, it&#039;s still best to take precautions.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;By killing every Necromancer you can find?&quot;</span> You ask. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I don&#039;t know... it seems to me that the Necromancers go on their killing sprees because they are so heavily persecuted. If they weren&#039;t killed for being who they are, wouldn&#039;t they just keep living peacefully in their villages?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko barks a short laugh. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You know, it&#039;s funny... I had a similar conversation with Cikul not too long ago. It&#039;s hard to argue against the weight of the prophecies, and the High Priests say that the influence of the Death Gods would lead to war and destruction in any case. If the policy seems harsh, remember that it was implemented in the wake of the Golgothan War. The Necromancers of the world had just proven incapable of peaceful coexistence with the Empire, and then a dire prophecy warns that they will attack again in the future? An attack that will destroy the Empire, and maybe the world? I can&#039;t fault the decision that the Emperor made.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You make a polite, noncommital noise, walking on in silence for a time. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What did you learn about the last priest to go to Aloclesno?&quot;</span> You ask, pointing at his book.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko pats the book in his arm. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Not too much. The priest was named Kiros Muleclenched, and while he didn&#039;t give the reason he entered the forest in his journal, later writers suggest it was an unhealthy fascination with Necromancy, as he grew up in the wake of the previous Necromancer War.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;The previous Necromancer War?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko nods impatiently. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yes, Seto the Necromancer, about two hundred fifty years ago. Kiros entered Alocelsno thirty years after Seto was defeated, and kept detailed notes on his actions while in the forest. He entered Aloclesno under the protection of a Minor Ward against Necromancy- the same ward that surrounds the forest- and made slow progress for two days, sleeping under the protection of a Major Ward. He traveled about fifteen miles into the forest, and cast a Sanctuary on a clearing he found that likely dates to the Golgothan War based on the abandoned weaponry he found there. The Sanctuary lasted for two days, during which he cast several divinations on portions of the forest untested since the Golgothan War, as well as exploring a bit on foot.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;And?&quot;</span> You ask eagerly. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What did he find?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko shakes his head. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Nothing. Nothing Necromantic, anyway; he made notes about plants not found outside the forest, but he found nothing to justify his caution. Ultimately he decided to leave the forest without risking his life further, and when he got out he was censured for priestly misconduct and misappropriation of Imperial funds; the mana potions he used weren&#039;t cheap, after all. The two charges together got him remanded to a monastery for... years afterward, anyway. Maybe the rest of his life.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Aren&#039;t you worried that will happen to you?&quot;</span> Omo asks.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko smiles to himself. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;No, not really. Oh, I&#039;ll probably get in trouble for risking my life on this mission, but I didn&#039;t waste Imperial funds to come along, and while such excursions are discouraged, they&#039;re not forbidden, especially with two recent victims in my care. I rather suspect there was more to Kiros&#039; punishment than a sabbatical in a haunted forest, judging by some comments made by later writers.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You said Kiros didn&#039;t go to the center of the forest, right?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko nods. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Not physically, no. He did cast several divinations that covered the center of the forest, however, and detected nothing. That was the greatest outcome of his journey, as the center of the forest is beyond easy divination range for any border village; to my knowledge, that is the only attempt at scrying that portion of the forest made since the Golgothan War.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;But if he&#039;s the only one to try, then he could have missed something, right?&quot;</span> You ask eagerly. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Maybe he miscast a spell, or made some other error.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I suppose it&#039;s possible.&quot;</span></span> Eko says dubiously. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It doesn&#039;t seem very likely, though. Kiros was described as being quite accomplished at divinations, and by his own account he was quite thorough. His testimony is the strongest evidence that there is nothing physical to find in Aloclesno.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We&#039;ll find something.&quot;</span> You reply confidently.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The conversation shifts to Aloclesno, and the creature(?) that waits there. Eko gives you a brief summary of some of his spells -a list which include the spells cast by Kiros- and admits that he isn&#039;t much of a fighter; his spear belongs to a traveler who left it behind long ago, and his only training with the weapon comes from serving in the militia of his hometown, an experience that is mandatory for youths in Thrimesdur.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Soon enough, you stand at the edge of the forest of Aloclesno, not too far from where you entered it last time. Very little of the mid-morning sunlight manages to shine beneath the dense canopy of the forest, giving the forest a dim, enclosed feeling. The trees which seemed so hostile in the nighttime are now merely disgruntled, unhappy about unwelcome guests.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko steps forward, seeming to feel the air in front of his face. <span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, the ward is just as I left it. No worries there. What do we do now?&quot;</span></span><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The time is upon you; how should you begin in your dealings with the forest?<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 11/11<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 12/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 26/35<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">80 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Headband, Belt Knife, <abbr title="1d6 damage, Slashing">Hatchet</abbr>, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="2 days of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr> <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr>, <abbr title="See detailed workings of Necromancy">Improved Necromantic Sight(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr>, <abbr title="can swim in calm, peaceful waters">Dabbling Swimmer</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Cautious<br />7th Felsite, <strong>Twenty two</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Your Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - Detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - Causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - You can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><strong>Waterproof</strong>- 1MP/Hour duration - Makes an object non-absorbent.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br />- Trying to develop a destroy vitality spell, using the same principles of the steal vitality, except without keeping it usable. It might be possible to do it for cheaper or causing more damage for the same mana.<br />- Trying to use the principles of the destroy vitality or the steal vitality spell for a disinfectant spell. It will require a lot of fine control, but it should theoretically be possible.<br />- We could also try to overbuff a zombie. Is there a max to the amount of vitality a zombie can have? And what happens if a zombie gets a lot of vitality?<br />&nbsp;* Remove someone&#039;s soul. Try to store it for a time in a living thing like a tree, or confine it in a mana crystal, then put it back later. See if they&#039;re functional.<br />&nbsp;* Attempt to swap souls between two different bodies.<br />&nbsp;* Carefully attempt to displace our own soul from our own body. See if we can move around apart from our bodies, like astral projection. See if we can cast while in this state, enter other occupied bodies like a possession, then return to our body later.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Northwest Thrimesdur<br /><a href="http://tnypic.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>

I just feel that with the threat of the necromancer looming we shouldn&#039;t waste any time.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Sanctuary- 9 MP - Casting time: 30 minutes. As Major Ward, but the field is strong enough to physically halt or oppose creatures and objects strongly imbued with the Magic in question. This field cannot be tied to a person or object, <span class="bbc_u">and the field is not physically tied to the area it is cast</span>.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>May I ask what this means exactly? The field is neither tied to objects nor areas? Does that mean that if it is cast while travelling on a boat for example, the field will travel with the boat? Or does that mean that it can be moved by using other spells?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s a weird distinction and not likely to come up, but:<br /><br />Minor/Major ward could be centered on a boat, and they&#039;d move along with that boat.<br /><br />Minor/Major ward could be cast on an area (say, an island,) and if crazy stupid magic made the island float away or sink or whatever, the ward would float/sink with it. Essentially, those spells treat the physical area the spell was cast like it was a discrete object, and move with it. If the hypothetical island were to break into pieces or otherwise be destroyed, then the ward would unravel prematurely.<br /><br />If Sanctuary were cast in an area on that island, and the island floated away, the Sanctuary... wouldn&#039;t. It&#039;d just hang out floating above the ocean until the duration ran out. It isn&#039;t anchored to anything physical, it&#039;s more of a metaphysical thing that Eko didn&#039;t go into much detail on in his summary. Incidentally, it would also be much harder to shift the Sanctuary through magical means (even more so if the Sanctuary is protecting against that kind of Magic, since it would basically unravel.)<br /><br />It is worded poorly, and should probably say something like &quot;and is not tied to the physical area it is cast&quot; instead. Like I said, rather unlikely to come up ever at all, and I don&#039;t foresee it even being a thing that <em>might </em>happen for the next, like, two chapters.<br /><br />Also, looks like the current consensus runs along the lines of &quot;no mobile wards, hoof it to nearby clearing, put up a stationary ward, various recon/questions suggestions from there.&quot;</div>

Yes, our first order of business should be to try and control and study the creature, but if that fails, we can kill it with Eko without using necromancy. We can say we used our elven magic (which is technically true since See Vitality is a very low level <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Life </strong></span>and <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Death </strong></span>spell that could be casted by someone without much magical capacity) to detect the creature, try to control it or impair it (which isn&#039;t visible) and if that fails use Eko&#039;s spells to repel it and kill it or trap it. This abjuration spell is especially interesting, since the creature is essentially a concentration of necromantic energy.<br /><br />Also, interesting to see that <strong>Order</strong> provides a means to see the structure of order spells, just like <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Death</strong></span> does for its own spells.<br /><br />That book account proves that at least the wards work against the creature.<br /><br />And the other stuff about the Necromantic gods and the prophecy is interesting too. We should make our way to the capital after this and hit the libraries for info about this Morka god and necromancy-related prophecies. And make a mental note to stay away from the emperor, just in case.<br /><br />We could make our way a bit deeper to the forest, as far as the clearing since it&#039;s a relatively short trip, set up a ward there and investigate the clearing and then the area just outside the ward&#039;s boarder, with Omo casting Detect Magic and us casting See Vitality. Maybe even investigate on our way there if we can maintain see vitality and detect magic for that long. Or we could set up a mobile ward and then make our way a bit deeper into the forest, but I think we can take a small risk and not waste that mana.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg4520055#msg4520055">Quote from: GlyphGryph on Wed 21-08-2013, 22:34:46</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Also, ask if all of this other guys spells were cast from inside the wards - maybe the wards were somehow interrupting the detection magic? Mention that you could no longer sense the vitality of your pursuers once you were outside the forest, indicating that the wards may be blocking your ability to detect them as well as their ability to detect you.<br /><br />So, Goals:<br />We&#039;ve got an improved version of detect vitality, which we might be able to use with our necromantic sight to really figure out more of what&#039;s going on with these creatures... IF we can get their attention. We should bring Omo with us, and talk about what&#039;s going on away from Eko&#039;s ears and talk about larger plans.<br /><br />If we fail to draw any attention...<br />Search the woods for animals. Are there any? Bugs, even? Why does this force seem to target people - are the trees flatlined in the same way somehow? Without bugs to pollinate them, how do they spread and persist?

Eko, can you protect us with a mobile ward on our way there?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;I can, but you&#039;ll have to stay close to me to remain within the ward&#039;s influence. You should be fine if you do not stray more than ten feet. How far is this clearing?&quot;</span></span> Eko asks.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Omo scratches his chin. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It isn&#039;t too far off; an hour&#039;s walk, maybe two.&quot;</span><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko nods absently, rummaging through his pack for his chalks. Pulling out a nub of yellow chalk, he begins muttering to himself as he traces odd patterns on his hands. Omo watches incredulously as Eko pulls back his sleeves to draw on his arms, then pulls up his robe to scrawl on his belly. You watch with interest; not from any particular desire to see Eko&#039;s stomach (which is rather chubby and distressingly hairy,) but because you want to see what Order Magic looks like.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately, this spell just looks like a crazy person rubbing himself with a piece of chalk. Though the patterns are quite intricate, full of square shapes and right angles, they don&#039;t look like anything special. After drawing on every body part Eko can easily reach, he spends a few minutes with his eyes closed, still murmuring incomprehensibly to himself. With a sigh, he opens his eyes and nods.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;There. One</span></span> <abbr title="4 mana, 4 hour duration"><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font">Minor Ward against Necromancy</span></span></abbr><span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">, ready to go. As I said, stay close, and you&#039;ll be protected as well as I am.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, if your spell is ready, there&#039;s no need to hang out on the edge of the forest. Lead the way, Omo!&quot;</span><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Omo leads you once more under the leaves of Aloclesno. The thick forest is much less oppressive in the daytime, though it is still rather gloomy. Perhaps the most striking difference is the noise; at night, the forest seemed unnaturally quiet, but by day the familiar chirping of birds and drone of insects fills the forest. Leaves rustle as a squirrel jumps to a smaller branch. Somewhere in the distance, a crow caws raucously.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;However, even the usual noises of forest life are drowned out by the tramping of Eko Cleanvise.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Omo throws up his arms as yet another dead branch cracks beneath Eko&#039;s feet. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Burn me to ash, but are you going to step on every twig in this forest, Eko? Because you&#039;re making a good start!&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Well excuse me for getting an education instead of playing in the woods all my life.&quot;</span></span> Eko grumbles. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Not everybody can ignore little things like calendars and souls in favor of moving like deer. Never did like forests; they&#039;re far too disorganized.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Omo snorts. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;All I&#039;m saying is that you&#039;re making enough noise to wake the dead.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;That&#039;s the plan, right? We&#039;ll rouse that Necromantic monster from whatever haven it hides in, and then deal with it once and for all.&quot;</span></span> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You wince as Eko shuffles through a pile of dead leaves. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, speaking of that; from what you said about Kiros&#039;s expedition, it seems like the wards kept the monster from finding him.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko nods. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;That is quite likely, yes.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Is it possible that the wards also kept him from finding the monster?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko shakes his head. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;No, that&#039;s not how the wards work. The Divinations are Order magic, and... they reach out past the wards, would be the easiest way to explain it. The wards would prevent Necromantic magic from entering- the stronger wards, anyway- but none of them would prevent Order magic from flowing out to find signs of Necromancy.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Hm. Well, to change the subject slightly, I&#039;m interested to know what kinds of tricks you can do with your Alarm spell.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko chuckles, twigs snapping beneath his feet. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Yes, that&#039;s quite a devious little spell. Some Wizards say the applications of Alarm are a school unto themselves. People have made some very clever things with Alarm; accurate timekeepers, intricate traps... one Wizard made a series of Alarms and Divinations that played a song from the sounds of different places.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Really? Could you, say, set an Alarm to trigger a Ward, or an Abjuration if we do something simple like break a stick?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Omo snorts. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;He&#039;s broken enough sticks, if you ask me.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko gives Omo a sour look before shaking his head. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;I know what you&#039;re thinking, but things are a little more complicated than that. I&#039;d still have to prepare a Ward the same as usual, so it would only work if you plan to lure this creature somewhere specific that I can prepare beforehand. And Equations and Divinations are even trickier, because they are not normally prepared for as Wards are. To tie one of those spells to an Alarm, I&#039;d have to simulate the conditions for casting them within the Alarm itself, in addition to the provisions that allow the spell to be held in suspension, which tends to make the spell both more expensive and more unstable.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So... you can&#039;t do it?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko sighs. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;I can try, but it&#039;s not easy. I can only tie one spell to an Alarm, and it will cost more Mana than casting the spells separately would. Centering a ward on a person, or casting a Divination or Abjuration would likely consume my entire mana pool. I certainly shouldn&#039;t try right now, if you want a ward at this clearing of yours.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Hm. Alright. I wish you had mentioned that when you were describing the spell earlier.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Forgive me for not relating my lifetime of magical studies on the walk here.&quot;</span></span> Eko says dryly.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Actually...&quot;</span> You reply, <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I had a random thought; do you know if mages of different Faiths can combine their spells? Life and Order, or Water and Earth, or something?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;That <em>is </em>an odd question.&quot;</span></span> Eko says with a grin. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;I don&#039;t know of any spells that absolutely require the presence of multiple Faiths. Of course, there are many spells which work well with those from other Faiths, merely by virtue of their effects. Legends tell of mythical weapons and armor forged by the combined efforts of Dwarven Earth Magicians and Fire Giant Invokers, for example, and occasionally mages of other Faiths will study with the Wizards to use their Divinations to aid their own research.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Interesting. Do you know-&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Hey.&quot;</span> Omo interrupts. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We&#039;re here.&quot;</span><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The clearing looks no different in the light of day than when you first saw it; the ground is flat and covered with tall grass and leaves, and two young trees near the center of the clearing stretch toward the midday sun. At a nod from you, Eko begins walking around the clearing, preparing to enclose the entire area in a <span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><abbr title="1 MP, lasts 1 Week"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong>Minor Ward</strong></span></abbr></span>. You cast <strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">See Vitality</span></span></span></strong>, and at your urging Omo casts Sense Vitality.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You take a moment to look at Omo and Eko with your newly-enhanced vision. As far as you can tell, the Vitality network within them moves just like that of Ado Drunkenstumbles back at the Temple, except they aren&#039;t wounded. You don&#039;t see anything new, and while every individual you&#039;ve looked at with this spell has had a unique Vitality system (Omo definitely has longer ears, among other things,) you don&#039;t notice any major differences between Omo and Eko. Of course, all this confirms is that something was very wrong with the Vitality of the victims of Aloclesno.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Examining the rest of the clearing reveals nothing out of the ordinary; the young trees are healthy saplings, the grass is basically tiny useless tubes of Vitality, and the surrounding trees all appear to be in good shape despite their unfriendly appearance. While Eko works on his ward, you and Omo take a quick circuit just outside the clearing.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So what exactly are we looking for?&quot;</span> Omo asks, stepping over a particularly large root.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I don&#039;t know.&quot;</span> You shrug. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Anything out of the normal, I guess. Have you seen any larger animals in here?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Not with that boar you brought along smashing through the brush.&quot;</span> Omo says, nodding toward Eko. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;But we were following a game trail most of the way here, so there must be some kind of larger wildlife in here. Probably deer.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Huh. So if there&#039;s some horrible Necromantic monster in here, why does it only target people, and not the other living things?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You tell me, you&#039;re the... you know.&quot;</span> Omo shrugs uncomfortably. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Speaking of that, what did you bring Eko along for? I thought we were keeping this kind of stuff on the down low.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;He&#039;s got some useful skills. And besides, I think if we prove our good nature to him, he won&#039;t try to kill me. He seems like a reasonable guy.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yeah, sure. Reasonable. Just a drunk and a liar.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;That seems a little harsh.&quot;</span> You say, frowning. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What have you got against Eko?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Eh, nothing, really.&quot;</span> Omo shrugs, bending to inspect a mossy rock. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I&#039;m just saying, he&#039;s not the most holy of priests. He&#039;s gonna let those kids die if we can&#039;t solve this thing, remember.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;That&#039;s their law; it&#039;s weird and wrong, but that&#039;s how it is. And he&#039;s not just letting them die; he&#039;s out here with us, right?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot;</span> Omo says, looking around. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Looks like Eko is done back at the camp; anything else you wanted to talk about out here?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Nothing that can&#039;t wait, I think.&quot;</span><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You&#039;ve seen no trace of the monster of Aloclesno; not surprising, since you&#039;ve been out from under the protection of Eko&#039;s ward for less than ten minutes. You rejoin the portly priest in the clearing.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;So this is where the kids fell, huh.&quot;</span></span> Eko says, looking around. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Well, this area is warded off, now. It&#039;ll be up for about a week, longer if I renew it. What should we do now?&quot;</span></span><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s not quite midday, and you still possess most of your mana. Eko is running low, though he still enjoys two more hours of protection from his mobile ward.

Has a duration of about one week, though each additional point of mana spent increases the duration of the ward by three or four weeks each.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong>Minor Ward</strong></span></span>- 1 MP - Casting time: 15 minutes, possibly longer if covering a larger or unusually shaped area (easily covers ~500 square feet.) Create a field against a specific Magical Faith in a specific place. Lasts for about a week, though each additional point of mana spent increases the duration of the ward by three or four weeks each.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br />- Trying to develop a destroy vitality spell, using the same principles of the steal vitality, except without keeping it usable. It might be possible to do it for cheaper or causing more damage for the same mana.<br />- Trying to use the principles of the destroy vitality or the steal vitality spell for a disinfectant spell. It will require a lot of fine control, but it should theoretically be possible.<br />- We could also try to overbuff a zombie. Is there a max to the amount of vitality a zombie can have? And what happens if a zombie gets a lot of vitality?<br />&nbsp;* Remove someone&#039;s soul. Try to store it for a time in a living thing like a tree, or confine it in a mana crystal, then put it back later. See if they&#039;re functional.<br />&nbsp;* Attempt to swap souls between two different bodies.<br />&nbsp;* Carefully attempt to displace our own soul from our own body. See if we can move around apart from our bodies, like astral projection. See if we can cast while in this state, enter other occupied bodies like a possession, then return to our body later.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Northwest Thrimesdur<br /><a href="http://tnypic.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Author&#039;s Notes</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Deep Waters</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Clarity&quot; is slightly confusing, imo. How long does Eko have to meditate to get that effect? Does he have to meditate during the attack or beforehand in preparation? If the latter, how long does the effect last? Etc. The wards could use range specifications in their descriptions (assuming we know their range; if not we should probably ask Eko).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Eko takes a few seconds to achieve the proper mental state to use his Clarity ability; it&#039;s the rough equivalent of a combat action, inasmuch as those exist in this game. He can use it to recover from mind-altering effects (be they enchantments or just booze/drugs) or he can do it ahead of time to resist them in the first place. He can maintain his Clarity for quite a while, but it does take effort and focus, so it&#039;s not something he could comfortably do for more than an hour or so. Note that this doesn&#039;t provide immunity, just resistance; he could still succumb to particularly strong magic/drugs, and of course he has to actually use the ability to enjoy the benefit, so it&#039;s less helpful if he&#039;s ensorcelled unawares. As a side note, he mentioned he habitually uses Clarity before prayers and sleeping, as most priests do.<br /><br />The wards lack range specifications since physically visiting/marking the location of the ward is assumed to be part of the casting; it would be difficult to cast a ward someplace he can&#039;t reach. I did add the rough maximum area of each Ward to the spell description; it&#039;s pretty much the same for any ward.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Deep Waters</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Also, the fact that Eko, who is clearly far more experienced than us, has 9 Mana in comparison to our 12, and has only twice the number of spells we have when we&#039;ve only been a true mage for twenty-two days really says something, I think.<br /><br />Something about our TALENT. <img src="./Necromancer/12.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley" /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I will note that this was the benefit of taking the Elf starting choice; higher magical capabilities than other races at the cost of nifty equipment, starting knowledge, and readily-accessible corpses. This is also the reason MP-potions are a cottage industry among the other races; they need the boost if they want to get in a full day of magicking.<br /><br /><br />Anywho let&#039;s see if I can get the next updoot out in <em>less </em>than a month.<br /></div></div></div>

I&#039;ve had a lot of fun with this, first as a game conceptualization and then as an avenue to practice my creative writing skills, but I think I have to admit that I&#039;m never going to get any better than I am, and if there&#039;s no way for me to take it to the next level then there&#039;s no point in plodding along. I think that&#039;s why I stopped, I just knew that this is the limit of how good it&#039;s possible for me to do. You are Necromancer is dead... in this incarnation anyway.<br /><br />See, I&#039;ve always wanted to do an ISG, and I figure I&#039;ve already got the hard stuff like rules and a setting in place here, so maybe I could reboot the story to help me develop as an artist. I know my art is going to be pretty rough to start out with, like how my writing was way back when, but I think if I tough it out and put some effort in then I can get better. Maybe not as good as freeformschooler or Solifuge or anyone with real talent like that, but self-improvement is the name of the game, right?<br /><br />So yeah.<br /><div align="center"><img src="./Necromancer/19.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /><img src="./Necromancer/20.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></div><br />You are <abbr title="Sorry, but Nym was always kindof a dumb name.

Though I do intend to make an <a href="http://tnypic.net/image/6ef" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">ISG</a> at some point, that day is not this day, and that thread is not this thread. Today, in lieu of a picture I present you a thousand words.<br /><br />Considering the length of time since the last update, here&#039;s a quick primer- You are Nym the Necromancer, and your quest to master your powers and create a new, better life for Necromancers as a whole has led you to journey to the Sacred Grove, ancestral home of the Elves which has been cursed by the ancient Necromancer Balkoth. Speaking of curses by the ancient Necromancer Balkoth, you now find yourself in a completely different forest which has been cursed in (probably) a completely different way. You are joined by your childhood (and current) best friend Omo who is willing to journey with you despite his misgivings about Necromancy, as well as fat man and local priest Eko Cleanvise who does not yet know of your magical alignment. Eko has told you what he knows of the Curse, and you believe to have encountered it personally on a previous foray into the forest to rescue Rismal and Nelti; now you hope to end the Curse once and for all.<br /><br />As a courtesy reminder, every update is linked in the OP, so if you need to jog your memory on what has happened since you came to Bedscaled (or since you left Yicelafo, or since Omo joined the party, or since you ate that fish that one time) you can easily find each post there.<br /><br />Thank you for your patience, and thanks for reading!<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Suggestions</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=96692.msg4622892#msg4622892">Quote from: Angle on Sat 21-09-2013, 07:38:25</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">First, take a good look at those two sapling trees we found the kids by.

Also, ask him to elaborate about those people of other faiths learning order divinations. If we don&#039;t have him spend all of his remaining mana, we should probably tell him that we&#039;re a necromancer, or make up a story to explain how we have the abilities we have. It would be really bad if we found the thing, subdued it, then had Eko freak out and attack us.

We can let those 2 make camp while we go and wait a small distance away from the border of this ward. And if nothing shows its face we can use our remaining mana to try experimenting with golems.

We could work on its body while waiting.<br /><br />If we had that golem it would be a good way to spend time that would normally be wasted: You&#039;re bored? Just merge your consciousness with the golem and take a look around. Or use it to watch where you&#039;re walking while you read a book. We can start with something small and weak, like a small bird made out of sticks, leaves, leather and rope with no brain and only simple muscles and eyes. And by pouring more vitality to it, adding upgraded or larger parts and refining its vitality network to make it smarter, stronger and overall more capable we might end up with a loyal companion, something like a giant winged robo-pet.<br /><br />@kahn 1234: Actually, the trees were there when we found the clearing.

It could have been the monster, or it could have been some other animal. No clear tracks of any kind, but this deep in the forest that&#039;s not too unusual.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Alright. I suppose it wasn&#039;t likely to be that easy. Let&#039;s check out those trees.&quot;</span> You turn, striding purposefully toward the saplings near the center of the clearing.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;The trees?&quot;</span></span> Eko echoes questioningly.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What about the trees?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You slowly circle the saplings, looking for any distinguishing marks or unusual characteristics. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Isn&#039;t it a little strange that when we found two soulless children, we also found a matching pair of young saplings?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I guess?&quot;</span> Omo says skeptically. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So what, you think their souls were turned into trees?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;That seems unlikely.&quot;</span></span> Eko says carefully.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You step back from the trees; from what you can tell, they aren&#039;t any different from the surrounding trees, apart from their age and location. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, no, not exactly. It just seems like an odd coincidence to me. All the other trees in this forest have been quite old.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, clearings like this one are the only place saplings can get enough sun to compete with the older trees.&quot;</span> Omo shrugs, kicking at an exposed root. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Coincidences do happen.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Just see if I missed anything, alright? Hey, Eko, why don&#039;t you try some Order Divinations or something?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;As you wish.&quot;</span></span> Eko says, bowing slightly. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Is there anything you&#039;d like me to check for specifically?&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yeah, why don&#039;t you use that spell you used to learn whether the kids still had a soul. Maybe Detect Undead? Whatever you think might help, we won&#039;t be doing too much exploring today.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;That would be my Diagnosis spell. It gives a general sense of a person&#039;s Vitality. Victims of Aloclesno have a signature weakness in their Vitality echo unlike anything else.&quot;</span></span> Eko begins digging around for his chalks, then pauses, looking up at you. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;I have never cast this spell on a <em>tree</em> before.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, cast it on a regular tree, then cast it on a sapling. That way, you&#039;ll notice any difference.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;That will use all of my mana.&quot;</span></span> Eko warns.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;That&#039;s alright, we&#039;ll save our real exploration for tomorrow.&quot;</span> You say reassuringly.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko nods, readying a piece of white chalk. He walks over to a largish tree just outside the ward, giving it a bemused glance before starting to draw on the trunk. You turn back to Omo, who is running one hand down the trunk of a sapling.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;So, do you notice anything strange about these saplings?&quot;</span> You say, squatting down next to him.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Omo shrugs, standing up. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I&#039;m a Ranger, not a Druid. These trees don&#039;t look sick, or... ensorcelled, or anything. Do <em>you</em> notice anything?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, no.&quot;</span> You admit, standing back up. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;But if there&#039;s one thing I&#039;ve learned about Necromancy, it&#039;s that things aren&#039;t always obvious.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Yeah, well, if there&#039;s anything subtle about this tree it eludes my powers of observation. What now?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You rub your chin thoughtfully. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;You go pitch camp- get Eko to help you when he&#039;s done with the tree. I&#039;m going to go play with dolls.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What?&quot;</span> Omo asks in bewilderment, but you&#039;re already walking away. Grumbling, he turns to the center of the clearing and begins unfolding his tent.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing on the edge of the clearing indicates that a Ward has been placed here; perhaps Eko does not need his chalks to cast that spell. Stepping into the shade of the trees, you stride away from the clearing, far enough to get a modicum of privacy. You want to spend some time outside the wards to see if your Necromantic powers can sense any sign of the Curse of Aloclesno, and perhaps just as importantly you want to do some experimenting with your powers while your traveling companions are occupied; you sense that Omo still isn&#039;t completely at ease with your powers, and of course Eko doesn&#039;t know about them at all.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<abbr title="Crafting 8">...</abbr> Sitting on a mossy log, you gather up materials you can find close at hand; your headband, various twigs and vines, dead leaves, that sort of thing. In your mind, you can envision a sort of rustic basket with cloth wings you could animate and cause to fly around. In practice, however, you find yourself creating new and exciting piles of junk. You keep at it doggedly, but it eventually becomes clear that you don&#039;t really know what you are doing, you lack the skill to assemble such a creation even if you knew what it was supposed to look like, and the materials you have on hand to make the thing you don&#039;t know how to assemble are likely not sufficient to the task. Perhaps at your next opportunity you should enlist the services of a craftsman to make this sort of complicated toy with moving parts; for now, it seems you should stick to simpler things.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Shaking the twigs out of your headband, you sweep your pile of prospective golem ingredients to the forest floor and regard your surroundings. Everything seems peaceful here; the odd sunbeam breaches the forest canopy here and there, but for the most part the only light is a verdant glow filtered through the leaves of the ancient trees. In a way, it reminds you of your Necromantic hideaway back in Yicelafo; of course, this time you aren&#039;t the only Necromantic thing lurking here. You have been away from Eko&#039;s ward for some time, but you have felt no presence nor sign of the monster you believe to stalk Aloclesno. Perhaps you need to give the Curse of Aloclesno more time to manifest, or perhaps you need to take more aggressive actions.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You shrug to yourself. You did not really expect to resolve this situation this afternoon anyway. Ducking back through the trees, you find the camp mostly settled. Omo has pitched your tent in the center of the clearing, near the young saplings. Technically it sleeps four, but Eko is a large man, and you don&#039;t know him very well; tonight could well be cozy. Omo is breathing life into a campfire, while Eko carefully stows his possessions in the tent. After brief discussion, you agree that with Eko&#039;s Mana spent it would be wise to camp out for the remainder of the day and start your search for the source of Aloclesno&#039;s Curse in the morning. It is a welcome opportunity to rest after the exertions of the past few days, as well as an opening to become better acquainted with your new tentmate.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko stretches back, looking up at the bright midafternoon sky visible through the treetops. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;You know, if you had told me a week ago that I would now be camping in Aloclesno with a pair of Elves while zombies threaten the village... well, I&#039;d have thought it&#039;s time to lay off the Longland Beer.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You arch your eyebrow quizzically. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I thought Sewer Brew was your drink of choice.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko sighs. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Longland Beer is a drink for happier times. These days, on my budget, there is a certain quality in quantity.&quot;</span></span> Sitting up, he fixes you with a stern look. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;But I do not think you came all the way here to discuss my drinking habits.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Why not?&quot;</span> Omo asks lazily. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We&#039;ve got nothing but time to kill.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko nods. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Yes. I did not press before, since you were my guests in my Temple, but now that we are out here...&quot;</span></span> Eko waves vaguely at the trees looming overhead. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;I have to ask; what brings a pair of Elves out into this forest in such dark times? Surely it is no coincidence that you seem so confident in your ability to handle the ancient Curse of Aloclesno at the same time the blight of Necromancy threatens the Empire.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You exchange guarded looks with Omo. You do not know that this is the right time to reveal yourself to Eko, but you do not want to lie to him, since it seems likely he will learn the truth sooner or later. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well... Omo there has trained with the Elven Rangers, and for myself I have a bit of magical ability and the desire to learn more. We both wanted to see some more of the world beyond Yicelafo, and when we heard about the Necromancers we thought to leave the Vale while we could.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko lets out a breath. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;So the Elves are not coming, then?&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;No, no, I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll mobilize against Curo Nightroar.&quot;</span> You reply quickly.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;I&#039;m not.&quot;</span> Omo says darkly. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;If I thought I could see the world in an official capacity, I wouldn&#039;t have left.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Well, there was some debate when we left.&quot;</span> You concede. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We made our opinions known, then decided that actions speak louder than words and... here we are.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;So your coming to my village is merely a... coincidence?&quot;</span></span> Eko says doubtfully.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Omo shrugs nonchalantly. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;The Necromancer is squatting on the main road, and when offered a choice between a haunted forest and a goblin-infested frontier, we chose the trees.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;We intend to travel to the capital at Atkilpeme, and from there we&#039;ll head to the remains of the Sacred Grove.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko leans back, stroking his chin. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;You mean the Golgothan Barrens?&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;The what?&quot;</span> You ask, befuddled.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;The Golgothan Barrens are what used to be the Sacred Grove, long ago. The whole place is dead and blasted, and supposedly is crawling with undead.&quot;</span></span> Eko chews his lip, visibly searching his memory. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;I don&#039;t remember much about it; I know that was one place where priests with my training could be sent. It&#039;s like Aloclesno; a dangerous place, but with even less reason to explore.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Where you could be sent? I thought you were from Bedscaled.&quot;</span> You ask quizzically.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;No, no.&quot;</span></span> Eko takes a quick nip from his flask, grimacing to himself. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Priests are not allowed to serve in their hometowns, or anywhere near if possible; it is a law that prevents favoritism. I&#039;m actually from Gilebe, in the south.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Gilebe?&quot;</span> Omo perks up, stirring the campfire with a long branch. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;That&#039;s where the Great River meets the sea, right? I&#039;ve heard stories about that place; the legendary acropolis, the shining walls, the biggest shipyard in the world!&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Yes, Gilebe is a fine city, perhaps the finest in Thrimesdur.&quot;</span></span> Eko says wistfully. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;It is certainly the oldest, and has a long and proud history. Even so, it cannot compare to Atkilpeme.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;What is Atkilpeme like?&quot;</span> You ask, curious about your future destination.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;You would like it, I think. It is an entirely planned city, with every structure fitting into a neat grid. I spent much of my time at the Great Temple, learning the duties of a priest. A beautiful place, very square and perfect, every inch of it laid down with such a love of detail... And the Wizard&#039;s College is wonderful as well. The Ivory Towers of the greatest Wizards rival the Great Temple itself for prominence in the city, and from what I&#039;ve seen of their interiors they may be even more beautiful and perfect.&quot;</span></span> Eko sighs happily. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;But what you&#039;d really like, Nym, is the Great Library. It&#039;s right between the Great Temple and the College grounds, not so tall or imposing as the buildings around it but still a sprawling, carefully built structure. There are so many books, on so many subjects... what scraps of free time I had between my duties with the principals of Atal and my studies at the College were spent there, just finding something interesting to sink my teeth into.&quot;</span></span> Eko says wistfully.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Omo snorts. <span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Sounds like a place to keep Nym away from; if I lose her in there, I&#039;d never find her.&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You stick your tongue out at Omo before turning back to Eko. <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color">&quot;It sounds like you spent your entire life in cities. How did you come to be a country priest?&quot;</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko shrugs. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Like everyone who is apprenticed to be a priest, I was tested for magical aptitude. I had some small talent with Order; not enough to ever hold a high rank within the College of Wizards, but plenty to supplement my priestly training. The very first spells I ever mastered were Wards, and they remain my strongest school of magic. I never had a real gift with Divination, which is what they look for in the more urban orders, and there is always a need for priests with Warding talents in problem areas like Aloclesno or the Golgothan Barrens. If I had applied myself more to magic I might have qualified for service in one of the border towns, but really, it just made sense to play to my strengths and accept this posting.&quot;</span></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: brown;" class="bbc_color">&quot;Was it hard going from the big city out here to the boondocks?&quot;</span> Omo asks, for once sounding genuinely curious.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko stares into the fire, nodding slowly. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;Yes... it was so different from anything I had done before, anywhere I had been before. It was hard to adapt, at first, and I&#039;m afraid I didn&#039;t make the best first impression. Still, it&#039;s been almost ten years now; I&#039;ve gotten used to life out here.&quot;</span></span> He looks up, smiling. <span style="color: orange;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&quot;At the end of the day, people are people, whether they&#039;re village goodwives or wizarding acolytes or merciless merchants.&quot;</span></span><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Eko spends the remainder of the afternoon telling anecdotes about his wizard training and his duties as the priest of Bedscaled, while you and Omo respond with similarly lighthearted stories about your childhood, daily life in Yicelafo, Omo&#039;s Ranger training and your checkered pasttimes (of which fishing was but the latest.) You find common ground with Eko in your fishing, as Eko used to regularly fish with his father on the banks of the Great River along with his father. Unexpectedly, Omo finds himself empathizing with Eko&#039;s stories about his strict teachers, and they swap stories about pranks they pulled (including some you didn&#039;t know Omo was responsible for; the incident with the pepper powder in your father&#039;s boots left him angry nearly as long as the sharp smell lingered in your home.)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Omo stokes the fire as night descends, and you all tuck into your provisions. Eko brought some dried meats, for which you gladly trade him some of your extra cheese; you decline to try his bread, which looks like a biscuit crossed with a rock. Eko doesn&#039;t complain as he softens it with his Sewer Brew, while you and Omo drink from the waterskins you brought along. Having spent much of the afternoon talking, there seems to be little reason to stay up late, and you all retire early with the expectation of an early start the following morning.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The tent is indeed cozier than you might have liked with Omo and Eko both crammed inside, but the night still gets cold enough to make the tight confines preferable to a spot by the fire. As you drift off to sleep, you can&#039;t stop planning your day tomorrow. You believe that somewhere in this forest is a Necromantic being of some kind, one that has remained hidden for centuries, one that remains incredibly dangerous. Deciding what to do when you find it is all well and good; first you need a firm search plan.<br /><br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: You</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><strong>Vitality</strong>- 11/11<br /><strong>Mana</strong>- 12/12<br /><strong>XP</strong>- 27/35<br /><strong>Inventory</strong>- Belt Pouch (<abbr title="1 Silver = 10 Copper- most business is done in silver or copper, although gold is used for high-end items">80 Silver Pieces</abbr>), <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks, Leather Boots, Leather Belt">Elven Traveler Garb</abbr></span>, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><abbr title="Mostly waterproof">Elven Cloak</abbr></span>, Headband, Belt Knife, <abbr title="1d6 damage, Slashing">Hatchet</abbr>, Leather Backpack(Bedroll, Flint&amp;Steel, <abbr title="2 points Mana">Weak Mana Potion</abbr>, Scroll Case(4 blank Parchment, <abbr title="10 bits">Charcoal</abbr>), <abbr title="1 day of flatbread and salty cheese">Trail Rations</abbr>, <abbr title="Fishhook, Line, Lures">Fishing Equipment</abbr>, <abbr title="Tunic, Undershirt, Leggings, Socks">Spare Traveling Clothes</abbr> x2, <em>Prestidigitation for the Beginning Practitioner</em> by Joddo Meadtrust, Crystal(5oz))<br /><strong>Abilities</strong>- <abbr title="Sense Necromantic Energy at a range of 5*Vitality*Vitality feet">Sense Necromancy(Passive)</abbr>, <abbr title="See detailed workings of Necromancy">Improved Necromantic Sight(Passive)</abbr><br /><strong>Skills</strong>- <abbr title="+2 fishing">Competent Fisher</abbr>, <abbr title="can swim in calm, peaceful waters">Dabbling Swimmer</abbr><br /><strong>Status</strong>- Curious<br />8th Felsite, <strong>Twenty three</strong> days since Manifestation<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Your Spells</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><span class="bbc_u">General</span><br /><strong>Detect Magic</strong>- 1 MP - Detects spells and magical items near you<br /><strong>Calm Animal</strong>- 1 MP - Causes wild animals to become peaceful<br /><strong>Sense Vitality</strong>- 1 MP - You can detect the Vitality of living things, with a bit of effort<br /><strong>Brew Mana Potion</strong>- A Mana Potion takes twice the potions potency in Mana cost, and requires 1/2 hour per point in brewing time<br /><strong>Waterproof</strong>- 1MP/Hour duration - Makes an object non-absorbent.

Creates a field that waits on a specific trigger, often the presence of a particular magical energy or the movement or destruction of a physical item. When activated, the field can either create a noise of some kind, or trigger another spell entirely. Has a duration of about one week, though each additional point of mana spent increases the duration of the ward by three or four weeks each.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong>Minor Ward</strong></span></span>- 1 MP - Casting time: 15 minutes, possibly longer if covering a larger or unusually shaped area (easily covers ~500 square feet.)

Allows you to hear at a distance by creating an invisible magical sensor at the location. Does not require line of sight, but the location of the sensor must be well known to the caster. Reduce the MP cost by one if the location of the sensor has been prepared beforehand (10 minutes of preparation time at physical location)<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Order Equations</span><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong>Minor Counterspell</strong></span></span>- 2 MP - Disrupts the casting of a specific spell; easily resisted, target can overcome Counterspell by spending extra mana.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font"><strong>Minor Mana Diffusion</strong></span></span>- 2 MP - Range: 30ft.

Take two crayfish. Shell one, leaving the meat inside as intact as possible. Remove the flesh from the second while leaving the shell as intact as possible. Attempt to revive both and compare the results. Is vitality in flesh or in bone? In both? Neither? Regardless of what we find, it should prove instructive.<br />-Try to find out if zombies have a memory, if they can be made to recognize specific objects. I recomend starting with a ball or something, and instructing a zombie to follow that specific ball wherever it goes. After testing it to make sure it works how we expect, substitute in another ball that has a different colour or a different size, and see if the zombie knows it isn&#039;t the right ball to follow. We can move to more abstract things from there, like having if understand things like &quot;any ball&quot; &quot;any non-red ball&quot; &quot;the biggest ball&quot; and stuff like that, or even to sort a pile of pebbles into stacks by colour.<br />-Attempt to raise a pile of ashes from a cremated corpse.<br />-Raise an earthworm and then, once it is raised, cut it in half at the border between two segments. Which ends, if any, are still animate? Continue cutting into halves at segment lines until all parts are dead or it has been divided into a prostomium, peristomium, pygidium and a pile of ordinary segments.<br />-See how much damage a dead body can sustain before it is unraisable<br />-Also, it seemed interesting that the loop was recognized as the center of life. We should test raising different rope Golems, some who are linear, some who are looped or knotted in different ways. How does the golem react to music, and what if we made one out of clay, with more distinguished features?<br />- For Animate Object, see if you can make an object levitate, or move to your will.&nbsp; Maybe this could develop into telekinesis..<br />- we should try pricking our finger, and stealing the vitality of an insect or something, and see if it will heal the cut. <br />- Another thing we need to play with is fire. Fire golem? HELL YES.<br />-Play with blood. Maybe that&#039;s what the golem needs. Blood. Mix some of your own blood into the clay.<br />-Like we tried to be the ropeman when we raised our first golem, we can try to be the earth when we make a clay or earthen golem, etc.<br />- Try to infuse vitality into the crystal to see what it does.<br />- See what happens if you infuse Mana and Vitality into the same crystal.<br />1. Imbue a small, uncrushed mana crystal with mana. Cast Detect Magic on it, comparing it to a mana potion.<br />2. If successful, turn the imbued mana crystal into a golem using 2 vitality. It is important to later experiments that we use exactly 2 vitality. Continue observing with Detect Magic.<br />3. If successful, attempt to Alter Golem in order to imbue the mana cystal with the ability to cast a cheap spell using the mana stored within it when commanded to. I recommend Detect Magic, since that should be easy to test.<br />4. If successful, continue to have the crystal cast Detect Magic even after it has run out of mana, in order to see if it can cast the spell using vitality like a mage can. Assuming this works, we will be able to discern the conversion ratio between vitality and mana.<br />5. If successful and the conversion ratio is &gt; 3 mana per 2 vitality, have a mana crystal that is able to hold at least 3 mana wrapped in thick leather with a single small hole. Firmly attach this leather-covered crystal to a stick that is suitable as a handle<br />6. Imbue 3 mana into the crystal before turning it into a 1 vitality golem that will cast Steal Vitality as quickly and often as it can on anything that comes within 4 feet of it, draining the vitality into itself.<br />7. Note to ourselves that, because Steal Vitality works on line of sight, only things that come within line of sight of the single hole in the leather will be drained of vitality.<br />8. Enjoy our new lightsaber.<br />- Trying to develop a destroy vitality spell, using the same principles of the steal vitality, except without keeping it usable. It might be possible to do it for cheaper or causing more damage for the same mana.<br />- Trying to use the principles of the destroy vitality or the steal vitality spell for a disinfectant spell. It will require a lot of fine control, but it should theoretically be possible.<br />- We could also try to overbuff a zombie. Is there a max to the amount of vitality a zombie can have? And what happens if a zombie gets a lot of vitality?<br />&nbsp;* Remove someone&#039;s soul. Try to store it for a time in a living thing like a tree, or confine it in a mana crystal, then put it back later. See if they&#039;re functional.<br />&nbsp;* Attempt to swap souls between two different bodies.<br />&nbsp;* Carefully attempt to displace our own soul from our own body. See if we can move around apart from our bodies, like astral projection. See if we can cast while in this state, enter other occupied bodies like a possession, then return to our body later.<br />-Our abilities seem centered around manipulation of vitality, correct? We should try to directly manipulate the vitality of a living thing. If we&#039;re unable to do that, then perhaps we could create a &quot;tainted&quot; orb of vitality, like a virus that once absorbed by the body of a living thing will disrupt its vitality network. A curse, essentially.<br /></div></div><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild; if(n.style.display == 'none') { n.style.display = 'block'; } else {	n.style.display = 'none';	} return false;">Spoiler: Maps</a> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">World Map<br /><img src="./Necromancer/8.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Northwest Thrimesdur<br /><a href="http://tnypic.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><img src="./Necromancer/13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></a><br /></div></div></div>
